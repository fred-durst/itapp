For most purposes, json2.js\nis the best choice.\n\n\njson2.js: This file creates a JSON property in the global object, if there\nisn\'t already one, setting its value to an object containing a stringify\nmethod and a parse method. The parse method uses the eval method to do the\nparsing, guarding it with several regular expressions to defend against\naccidental code execution hazards. On current browsers, this file does nothing,\nprefering the built-in JSON object.\n\njson.js: This file does everything that json2.js does. It also adds a\ntoJSONString method and a parseJSON method to Object.prototype.

This module can help:\n\n``` javascript\nvar stackTrace = require(\'stack-trace\');\nvar err = new Error(\'something went wrong\');\nvar trace = stackTrace.parse(err);\n\nrequire(\'assert\').strictEqual(trace[0].getFileName(), __filename);\n```\n\nPlease note that parsing the `Error#stack` property is not perfect, only\ncertain properties can be retrieved with it as noted in the API docs below.\n\n## Long stack traces\n\nstack-trace works great with [long-stack-traces][], when parsing an `err.stack`\nthat has crossed the event loop boundary, a `CallSite` object returning\n`\'----------------------------------------\'` for `getFileName()` is created.\nAll other methods of the event loop boundary call site return `null`.\n\n[long-stack-traces]: https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces\n\n## API\n\n### stackTrace.get([belowFn])\n\nReturns an array of `CallSite` objects, where element `0` is the current call\nsite.\n\nWhen passing a function on the current stack as the `belowFn` parameter, the\nreturned array will only include `CallSite` objects below this function.\n\n### stackTrace.parse(err)\n\nParses the `err.stack` property of an `Error` object into an array compatible\nwith those returned by `stackTrace.get()`. However, only the following methods\nare implemented on the returned `CallSite` objects.\n\n* getTypeName\n* getFunctionName\n* getMethodName\n* getFileName\n* getLineNumber\n* getColumnNumber\n* isNative\n\nNote: Except `getFunctionName()`, all of the above methods return exactly the\nsame values as you would get from `stackTrace.get()`. `getFunctionName()`\nis sometimes a little different, but still useful.\n\n### CallSite\n\nThe official v8 CallSite object API can be found [here][v8stackapi]. A quick\nexcerpt:\n\n> A CallSite object defines the following methods:\n>\n> * **getThis**: returns the value of this\n> * **getTypeName**: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object\'s [[Class]] internal property.\n> * **getFunction**: returns the current function\n> * **getFunctionName**: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function\'s context.\n> * **getMethodName**: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function\n> * **getFileName**: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script\n> * **getLineNumber**: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number\n> * **getColumnNumber**: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number\n> * **getEvalOrigin**: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called\n> * **isToplevel**: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?\n> * **isEval**: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?\n> * **isNative**: is this call in native V8 code?\n> * **isConstructor**: is this a constructor call?\n\n[v8stackapi]: http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi\n\n## License\n\nstack-trace is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

48051 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser.\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, forEach…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n    async.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n        // results is now an array of stats for each file\n    });\n\n    async.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n        // results now equals an array of the existing files\n    });\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(){ ... },\n        function(){ ... }\n    ], callback);\n\n    async.series([\n        function(){ ... },\n        function(){ ... }\n    ]);\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n\n## Download\n\nReleases are available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async/downloads).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n    npm install async\n\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 17.5kb Uncompressed\n\n__Production:__ [async.min.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/dist/async.min.js) - 1.7kb Packed and Gzipped\n\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far its been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. Usage:\n\n    <script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n    <script type="text/javascript">\n\n        async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n            alert(results);\n        });\n\n    </script>\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [forEach](#forEach)\n* [map](#map)\n* [filter](#filter)\n* [reject](#reject)\n* [reduce](#reduce)\n* [detect](#detect)\n* [sortBy](#sortBy)\n* [some](#some)\n* [every](#every)\n* [concat](#concat)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [series](#series)\n* [parallel](#parallel)\n* [whilst](#whilst)\n* [until](#until)\n* [waterfall](#waterfall)\n* [queue](#queue)\n* [auto](#auto)\n* [iterator](#iterator)\n* [apply](#apply)\n* [nextTick](#nextTick)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [memoize](#memoize)\n* [unmemoize](#unmemoize)\n* [log](#log)\n* [dir](#dir)\n* [noConflict](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n### forEach(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies an iterator function to each item in an array, in parallel.\nThe iterator is called with an item from the list and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main\ncallback for the forEach function is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n    // to save the modified contents of that file:\n\n    async.forEach(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n### forEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as forEach only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n### forEachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as forEach only the iterator is applied to batches of items in the\narray, in series. The next batch of iterators is only called once the current\none has completed processing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* limit - How many items should be in each batch.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n    // function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\n    async.forEachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n    });\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in the given array through\nthe iterator function. The iterator is called with an item from the array and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. The callback takes 2 arguments, \nan error and the transformed item from the array. If the iterator passes an\nerror to this callback, the main callback for the map function is immediately\ncalled with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order, however\nthe results array will be in the same order as the original array.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n        // results is now an array of stats for each file\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as map only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ select\n\nReturns a new array of all the values which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n        // results now equals an array of the existing files\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__alias:__ selectSeries\n\nThe same as filter only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of filter. Removes values that pass an async truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as filter, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__aliases:__ inject, foldl\n\nReduces a list of values into a single value using an async iterator to return\neach successive step. Memo is the initial state of the reduction. This\nfunction only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to\nsplit a call to this function into a parallel map, then use the normal\nArray.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where\neach step in the reduction needs to be async, if you can get the data before\nreducing it then its probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* memo - The initial state of the reduction.\n* iterator(memo, item, callback) - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iterator is passed a\n  callback which accepts an optional error as its first argument, and the state\n  of the reduction as the second. If an error is passed to the callback, the\n  reduction is stopped and the main callback is immediately called with the\n  error.\n* callback(err, result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n        // pointless async:\n        process.nextTick(function(){\n            callback(null, memo + item)\n        });\n    }, function(err, result){\n        // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ foldr\n\nSame as reduce, only operates on the items in the array in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in a list that passes an async truth test. The\niterator is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return true will\nfire the detect callback with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original array (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original array is important then look at detectSeries.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value undefined if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as detect, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original array (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each value through an async iterator.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and a value to use as the sort criteria.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is the items from\n  the original array sorted by the values returned by the iterator calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n        fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n            callback(err, stats.mtime);\n        });\n    }, function(err, results){\n        // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n        // modified date\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ any\n\nReturns true if at least one element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. Once any iterator\ncall returns true, the main callback is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either true or false depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ all\n\nReturns true if every element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished.

Returns the\nconcatenated list. The iterators are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of the arguments passed to the iterator function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and an array of results.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the iterator function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n        // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as async.concat, but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run and the callback for the series is\nimmediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed,\nthe results are passed to the final callback as an array.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.series.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a callback it must call on completion.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets an array of all the arguments passed to\n  the callbacks used in the array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            // do some stuff ...\n            callback(null, \'one\');\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // do some more stuff ...\n            callback(null, \'two\');\n        },\n    ],\n    // optional callback\n    function(err, results){\n        // results is now equal to [\'one\', \'two\']\n    });\n\n\n    // an example using an object instead of an array\n    async.series({\n        one: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 1);\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        two: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 2);\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    },\n    function(err, results) {\n        // results is now equal to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallel" />\n### parallel(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous\nfunction has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its\ncallback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error.\nOnce the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an\narray.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.parallel.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed a\n  callback it must call on completion.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets an array of all the arguments passed to\n  the callbacks used in the array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, \'one\');\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, \'two\');\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    ],\n    // optional callback\n    function(err, results){\n        // the results array will equal [\'one\',\'two\'] even though\n        // the second function had a shorter timeout.\n    });\n\n\n    // an example using an object instead of an array\n    async.parallel({\n        one: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 1);\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        two: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 2);\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    },\n    function(err, results) {\n        // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="whilst" />\n### whilst(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, while test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* test() - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn.\n* fn(callback) - A function to call each time the test passes. The function is\n  passed a callback which must be called once it has completed with an optional\n  error as the first argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated\n  execution of fn has stopped.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var count = 0;\n\n    async.whilst(\n        function () { return count < 5; },\n        function (callback) {\n            count++;\n            setTimeout(callback, 1000);\n        },\n        function (err) {\n            // 5 seconds have passed\n        }\n    );\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="until" />\n### until(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, until test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\nThe inverse of async.whilst.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns an array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the functions pass an error to the callback, the\nnext function is not executed and the main callback is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback it\n  must call on completion.\n* callback(err, [results]) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.waterfall([\n        function(callback){\n            callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n        },\n        function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n            callback(null, \'three\');\n        },\n        function(arg1, callback){\n            // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n            callback(null, \'done\');\n        }\n    ], function (err, result) {\n       // result now equals \'done\'    \n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a queue object with the specified concurrency. Tasks added to the\nqueue will be processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit). If all\nworkers are in progress, the task is queued until one is available. Once\na worker has completed a task, the task\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* worker(task, callback) - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task.\n* concurrency - An integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe queue object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* length() - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* concurrency - an integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a queue is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* push(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the queue, the callback is called\n  once the worker has finished processing the task.\n  instead of a single task, an array of tasks can be submitted. the respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* saturated - a callback that is called when the queue length hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued\n* empty - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue is given to a worker\n* drain - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue has returned from the worker\n\n__Example__\n\n    // create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\n    var q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n        console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n        callback();\n    }, 2);\n\n\n    // assign a callback\n    q.drain = function() {\n        console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n    }\n\n    // add some items to the queue\n\n    q.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n    });\n    q.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n    });\n\n    // add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\n    q.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running functions based on their requirements.\nEach function can optionally depend on other functions being completed first,\nand each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. If any of\nthe functions pass an error to their callback, that function will not complete\n(so any other functions depending on it will not run) and the main callback\nwill be called immediately with the error. Functions also receive an object\ncontaining the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An object literal containing named functions or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The key\n  used for each function or array is used when specifying requirements. The\n  syntax is easier to understand by looking at the example.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. The callback will receive an error as an argument\n  if any tasks pass an error to their callback. If all tasks complete\n  successfully, it will receive an object containing their results.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.auto({\n        get_data: function(callback){\n            // async code to get some data\n        },\n        make_folder: function(callback){\n            // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n            // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        },\n        write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback){\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            callback(null, filename);\n        }],\n        email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        }]\n    });\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            // async code to get some data\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n            // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        }\n    ],\n    function(results){\n        async.series([\n            function(callback){\n                // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n                // write the data to a file in the directory\n            },\n            email_link: function(callback){\n                // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            }\n        ]);\n    });\n\nFor a complicated series of async tasks using the auto function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier and makes the code more readable.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. Its also possible to\n\'peek\' the next iterator by doing iterator.next().\n\nThis function is used internally by the async module but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback it\n  must call on completion.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var iterator = async.iterator([\n        function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n        function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n        function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n    ]);\n\n    node> var iterator2 = iterator();\n    \'one\'\n    node> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n    \'two\'\n    node> iterator3();\n    \'three\'\n    node> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\n    node> nextfn();\n    \'three\'\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied, a useful\nshorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // using apply\n\n    async.parallel([\n        async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n        async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n    ]);\n\n\n    // the same process without using apply\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n        },\n    ]);\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n    node> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\n    node> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\n    one\n    two\n    three\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls the callback on a later loop around the event loop. In node.js this just\ncalls process.nextTick, in the browser it falls back to setTimeout(callback, 0),\nwhich means other higher priority events may precede the execution of the callback.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* callback - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var call_order = [];\n    async.nextTick(function(){\n        call_order.push(\'two\');\n        // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two]\n    });\n    call_order.push(\'one\')\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the function you to proxy and cache results from.\n* hasher - an optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results, it has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n        // do something\n        callback(null, result);\n    };\n    var fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n    // fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\n    fn(\'some name\', function () {\n        // callback\n    });\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a memoized function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Comes handy in tests.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.log and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.log is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var hello = function(name, callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n        }, 1000);\n    };\n\n    node> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n    \'hello world\'\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console using console.dir to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.dir and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.dir is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var hello = function(name, callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, {hello: name});\n        }, 1000);\n    };\n\n    node> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n    {hello: \'world\'}\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of async back to its original value, returning a reference to the\nasync object.\n',

48051 silly resolved     readme: '# Request -- Simplified HTTP request method\n\n## Install\n\n<pre>\n  npm install request\n</pre>\n\nOr from source:\n\n<pre>\n  git clone git://github.com/mikeal/request.git \n  cd request\n  npm link\n</pre>\n\n## Super simple to use\n\nRequest is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```javascript\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types, in this case `application/json`, and use the proper content-type in the PUT request if one is not already provided in the headers.\n\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also pipe to itself. When doing so the content-type and content-length will be preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let\'s get fancy.\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    } \n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also pipe() from a http.ServerRequest instance and to a http.ServerResponse instance. The HTTP method and headers will be sent as well as the entity-body data. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since pipe() returns the destination stream in node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying :)\n\n```javascript\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n```javascript\n// Twitter OAuth\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Assume by some stretch of magic you aquired the verifier\n  var access_token = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth = \n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: access_token.oauth_token\n      , verifier: VERIFIER\n      , token_secret: access_token.oauth_token_secret\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    var perm_token = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth = \n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_token.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_token.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json?\'\n      , params = \n        { screen_name: perm_token.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_token.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    url += qs.stringify(params)\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a url or an options object. The only required option is uri, all others are optional.\n\n* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from url.parse()\n* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the uri\n* `method` - http method, defaults to GET\n* `headers` - http headers, defaults to {}\n* `body` - entity body for POST and PUT requests. Must be buffer or string.\n* `form` - sets `body` but to querystring representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8` header.\n* `json` - sets `body` but to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.\n* `multipart` - (experimental) array of objects which contains their own headers and `body` attribute. Sends `multipart/related` request. See example below.\n* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to true.\n* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to false.\n* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow, defaults to 10.\n* `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If set to `null`, the body is returned as a Buffer.\n* `pool` - A hash object containing the agents for these requests. If omitted this request will use the global pool which is set to node\'s default maxSockets.\n* `pool.maxSockets` - Integer containing the maximum amount of sockets in the pool.\n* `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request\t\n* `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Support proxy Auth with Basic Auth the same way it\'s supported with the `url` parameter by embedding the auth info in the uri.\n* `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing, see documentation above.\n* `strictSSL` - Set to `true` to require that SSL certificates be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that ca as an option.\n* `jar` - Set to `false` if you don\'t want cookies to be remembered for future use or define your custom cookie jar (see examples section)\n\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments. The first is an error when applicable (usually from the http.Client option not the http.ClientRequest object). The second in an http.ClientResponse object. The third is the response body String or Buffer.\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n### request.defaults(options)  \n  \nThis method returns a wrapper around the normal request API that defaults to whatever options you pass in to it.\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.del(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nAlias to normal request method for uniformity.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.cookie(\'cookie_string_here\')\n```\n### request.jar\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart: \n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ] \n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\nCookies are enabled by default (so they can be used in subsequent requests). To disable cookies set jar to false (either in defaults or in the options sent).\n\n```javascript\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: false})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nIf you to use a custom cookie jar (instead of letting request use its own global cookie jar) you do so by setting the jar default or by specifying it as an option:\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\nOR\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'your_cookie_here\')\nj.add(cookie)\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n',

48051 silly resolved     readme: '# node-pkginfo\n\nAn easy way to expose properties on a module from a package.json\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing npm (node package manager)\n```\n  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### Installing pkginfo\n```\n  [sudo] npm install pkginfo\n```\n\n## Motivation\nHow often when writing node.js modules have you written the following line(s) of code? \n\n* Hard code your version string into your code\n\n``` js\n  exports.version = \'0.1.0\';\n```\n\n* Programmatically expose the version from the package.json\n\n``` js\n  exports.version = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(\'/path/to/package.json\', \'utf8\')).version;\n```\n\nIn other words, how often have you wanted to expose basic information from your package.json onto your module programmatically? **WELL NOW YOU CAN!**\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing `pkginfo` is idiot-proof, just require and invoke it. \n\n``` js\n  var pkginfo = require(\'pkginfo\')(module);\n  \n  console.dir(module.exports);\n```\n\nBy invoking the `pkginfo` module all of the properties in your `package.json` file will be automatically exposed on the callee module (i.e. the parent module of `pkginfo`). \n\nHere\'s a sample of the output:\n\n```\n  { name: \'simple-app\',\n    description: \'A test fixture for pkginfo\',\n    version: \'0.1.0\',\n    author: \'Charlie Robbins <charlie.robbins@gmail.com>\',\n    keywords: [ \'test\', \'fixture\' ],\n    main: \'./index.js\',\n    scripts: { test: \'vows test/*-test.js --spec\' },\n    engines: { node: \'>= 0.4.0\' } }\n```\n\n### Expose specific properties\nIf you don\'t want to expose **all** properties on from your `package.json` on your module then simple pass those properties to the `pkginfo` function:\n\n``` js\n  var pkginfo = require(\'pkginfo\')(module, \'version\', \'author\');\n  \n  console.dir(module.exports);\n```\n\n```\n  { version: \'0.1.0\',\n    author: \'Charlie Robbins <charlie.robbins@gmail.com>\' }\n```\n\nIf you\'re looking for further usage see the [examples][0] included in this repository. \n\n## Run Tests\nTests are written in [vows][1] and give complete coverage of all APIs.\n\n```\n  vows test/*-test.js --spec\n```\n\n[0]: https://github.com/indexzero/node-pkginfo/tree/master/examples\n[1]: http://vowsjs.org\n\n#### Author: [Charlie Robbins](http://nodejitsu.com)',

48491 silly resolved     readme: '# combined-stream\n\nA stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install combined-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine\ntwo files into one:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nWhile the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until\nthey are needed. If you don\'t want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`\nto `false`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nHowever, what if you don\'t have all the source streams yet, or you don\'t want\nto allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?\nWell, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream\nby calling a `next()` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\n});\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n});\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### CombinedStream.create([options])\n\nReturns a new combined stream object. Available options are:\n\n* `maxDataSize`\n* `pauseStreams`\n\nThe effect of those options is described below.\n\n### combinedStream.pauseStreams = true\n\nWhether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,\nthe underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the\nunderlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when\n`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.\n\n### combinedStream.maxDataSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024\n\nThe maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.\nIf this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `\'error\'` event.\n\n### combinedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.\n\n### combinedStream.append(stream)\n\nAppends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is\nset to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.\n\n`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`\nis a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see\nexample above.\n\nRegardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an\n`\'error\'` listener to it, so you don\'t have to do that manually.\n\nSpecial case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.\n\n### combinedStream.write(data)\n\nYou should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended\nstreams into itself for you.\n\n### combinedStream.resume()\n\nCauses `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is\nidempotent, and also emits a `\'resume\'` event each time which usually goes to\nthe stream that is currently being drained.\n\n### combinedStream.pause();\n\nIf `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.\nOtherwise a `\'pause\'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is\ncurrently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\n\n### combinedStream.end();\n\nSets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `\'end\'` event, and removes\nall streams from the queue.\n\n### combinedStream.destroy();\n\nSame as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `\'close\'` event instead of\n`\'end\'`.\n\n## License\n\ncombined-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

I put it in the logs.&quot;</span>\n\n## Motivation\nWinston is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports. A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file.\n\nThere also seemed to be a lot of logging libraries out there that coupled their implementation of logging (i.e. how the logs are stored / indexed) to the API that they exposed to the programmer. This library aims to decouple those parts of the process to make it more flexible and extensible.\n\n## Usage\nThere are two different ways to use winston: directly via the default logger, or by instantiating your own Logger. The former is merely intended to be a convenient shared logger to use throughout your application if you so choose.\n\n* [Logging](#logging)\n  * [Using the Default Logger](#using-the-default-logger)\n  * [Instantiating your own Logger](#instantiating-your-own-logger)\n  * [Logging with Metadata](#logging-with-metadata)\n* [Transports](https://github.com/flatiron/winston/blob/master/docs/transports.md)\n* [Profiling](#profiling)\n* [Streaming Logs](#streaming-logs)\n* [Querying Logs](#querying-logs)  \n* [Exceptions](#exceptions)\n  * [Handling Uncaught Exceptions with winston](#handling-uncaught-exceptions-with-winston)\n  * [To Exit or Not to Exit](#to-exit-or-not-to-exit)\n* [Logging Levels](#logging-levels)\n  * [Using Logging Levels](#using-logging-levels)\n  * [Using Custom Logging Levels](#using-custom-logging-levels)\n* [Further Reading](#further-reading)\n  * [Events and Callbacks in Winston](#events-and-callbacks-in-winston)\n  * [Working with multiple Loggers in winston](#working-with-multiple-loggers-in-winston)\n  * [Using winston in a CLI tool](#using-winston-in-a-cli-tool)\n  * [Extending another object with Logging](#extending-another-object-with-logging)\n  * [Adding Custom Transports](#adding-custom-transports)\n\n## Logging\n\n### Using the Default Logger\nThe default logger is accessible through the winston module directly. Any method that you could call on an instance of a logger is available on the default logger:\n\n``` js\n  var winston = require(\'winston\');\n\n  winston.log(\'info\', \'Hello distributed log files!\');\n  winston.info(\'Hello again distributed logs\');\n```\n\nBy default, only the Console transport is set on the default logger. You can add or remove transports via the add() and remove() methods:\n\n``` js\n  winston.add(winston.transports.File, { filename: \'somefile.log\' });\n  winston.remove(winston.transports.Console);\n```\n\nFor more documenation about working with each individual transport supported by Winston see the "Working with Transports" section below.\n\n### Instantiating your own Logger\nIf you would prefer to manage the object lifetime of loggers you are free to instantiate them yourself:\n\n``` js\n  var logger = new (winston.Logger)({\n    transports: [\n      new (winston.transports.Console)(),\n      new (winston.transports.File)({ filename: \'somefile.log\' })\n    ]\n  });\n```\n\nYou can work with this logger in the same way that you work with the default logger:\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Logging\n  //\n  logger.log(\'info\', \'Hello distributed log files!\');\n  logger.info(\'Hello again distributed logs\');\n\n  //\n  // Adding / Removing Transports\n  //   (Yes It\'s chainable)\n  //\n  logger.add(winston.transports.File)\n        .remove(winston.transports.Console);\n```\n\n### Logging with Metadata\nIn addition to logging string messages, winston will also optionally log additional JSON metadata objects. Adding metadata is simple:\n\n``` js\n  winston.log(\'info\', \'Test Log Message\', { anything: \'This is metadata\' });\n```\n\nThe way these objects is stored varies from transport to transport (to best support the storage mechanisms offered). Here\'s a quick summary of how each transports handles metadata:\n\n1. __Console:__ Logged via util.inspect(meta)\n2. __File:__ Logged via util.inspect(meta)\n\n## Profiling\nIn addition to logging messages and metadata, winston also has a simple profiling mechanism implemented for any logger:\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Start profile of \'test\'\n  // Remark: Consider using Date.now() with async operations\n  //\n  winston.profile(\'test\');\n\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    //\n    // Stop profile of \'test\'. Logging will now take place:\n    //   "17 Jan 21:00:00 - info: test duration=1000ms"\n    //\n    winston.profile(\'test\');\n  }, 1000);\n```\n\nAll profile messages are set to the \'info\' by default and both message and metadata are optional There are no plans in the Roadmap to make this configurable, but I\'m open to suggestions / issues.\n\n\n## Querying Logs\nWinston supports querying of logs with Loggly-like options.\nSpecifically: `File`, `Couchdb`, `Redis`, `Loggly`, `Nssocket`, and `Http`.\n\n``` js\n  var options = {\n    from: new Date - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,\n    until: new Date\n  };\n\n  //\n  // Find items logged between today and yesterday.\n  //\n  winston.query(options, function (err, results) {\n    if (err) {\n      throw err;\n    }\n    \n    console.log(results);\n  });\n```\n\n## Streaming Logs\nStreaming allows you to stream your logs back from your chosen transport.\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Start at the end.\n  //\n  winston.stream({ start: -1 }).on(\'log\', function(log) {\n    console.log(log);\n  });\n```\n\n## Exceptions\n\n### Handling Uncaught Exceptions with winston\n\nWith `winston`, it is possible to catch and log `uncaughtException` events from your process. There are two distinct ways of enabling this functionality either through the default winston logger or your own logger instance.\n\nIf you want to use this feature with the default logger simply call `.handleExceptions()` with a transport instance.\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // You can add a separate exception logger by passing it to `.handleExceptions`\n  //\n  winston.handleExceptions(new winston.transports.File({ filename: \'path/to/exceptions.log\' }))\n\n  //\n  // Alternatively you can set `.handleExceptions` to true when adding transports to winston\n  //\n  winston.add(winston.transports.File, {\n    filename: \'path/to/all-logs.log\',\n    handleExceptions: true\n  });\n```\n\n### To Exit or Not to Exit\n\nby default, winston will exit after logging an uncaughtException. if this is not the behavior you want,\nset `exitOnError = false`\n\n``` js\n  var logger = new (winston.Logger)({ exitOnError: false });\n\n  //\n  // or, like this:\n  //\n  logger.exitOnError = false;\n```\n\nWhen working with custom logger instances, you can pass in separate transports to the `exceptionHandlers` property or set `.handleExceptions` on any transport.\n\nExample 1\n\n``` js\n  var logger = new (winston.Logger)({\n    transports: [\n      new winston.transports.File({ filename: \'path/to/all-logs.log\' })\n    ]\n    exceptionHandlers: [\n      new winston.transports.File({ filename: \'path/to/exceptions.log\' })\n    ]\n  });\n```\n\nExample 2\n\n```\nvar logger = new winston.Logger({\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.Console({\n      handleExceptions: true,\n      json: true\n    })\n  ],\n  exitOnError: false\n});\n```\n\nThe `exitOnError` option can also be a function to prevent exit on only certain types of errors:\n\n``` js\n  function ignoreEpipe(err) {\n    return err.code !== \'EPIPE\';\n  }\n\n  var logger = new (winston.Logger)({ exitOnError: ignoreEpipe });\n\n  //\n  // or, like this:\n  //\n  logger.exitOnError = ignoreEpipe;\n```\n\n## Logging Levels\n\n### Using Logging Levels\nSetting the level for your logging message can be accomplished in one of two ways. You can pass a string representing the logging level to the log() method or use the level specified methods defined on every winston Logger.\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Any logger instance\n  //\n  logger.log(\'info\', "127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n  logger.log(\'warn\', "127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n  logger.log(\'error\', "127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n  logger.info("127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n  logger.warn("127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n  logger.error("127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n\n  //\n  // Default logger\n  //\n  winston.log(\'info\', "127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n  winston.info("127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home");\n```\n\nWinston allows you to set a `level` on each transport that specifies the level of messages this transport should log. For example, you could log only errors to the console, with the full logs in a file:\n\n``` js\n  var logger = new (winston.Logger)({\n    transports: [\n      new (winston.transports.Console)({ level: \'error\' }),\n      new (winston.transports.File)({ filename: \'somefile.log\' })\n    ]\n  });\n```\n\nAs of 0.2.0, winston supports customizable logging levels, defaulting to [npm][0] style logging levels. Changing logging levels is easy:\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Change levels on the default winston logger\n  //\n  winston.setLevels(winston.config.syslog.levels);\n\n  //\n  // Change levels on an instance of a logger\n  //\n  logger.setLevels(winston.config.syslog.levels);\n```\n\nCalling `.setLevels` on a logger will remove all of the previous helper methods for the old levels and define helper methods for the new levels. Thus, you should be careful about the logging statements you use when changing levels. For example, if you ran this code after changing to the syslog levels:\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Logger does not have \'silly\' defined since that level is not in the syslog levels\n  //\n  logger.silly(\'some silly message\');\n```\n\n### Using Custom Logging Levels\nIn addition to the predefined `npm` and `syslog` levels available in Winston, you can also choose to define your own:\n\n``` js\n  var myCustomLevels = {\n    levels: {\n      foo: 0,\n      bar: 1,\n      baz: 2,\n      foobar: 3\n    },\n    colors: {\n      foo: \'blue\',\n      bar: \'green\',\n      baz: \'yellow\',\n      foobar: \'red\'\n    }\n  };\n\n  var customLevelLogger = new (winston.Logger)({ levels: myCustomLevels.levels });\n  customLevelLogger.foobar(\'some foobar level-ed message\');\n```\n\nAlthough there is slight repetition in this data structure, it enables simple encapsulation if you not to have colors. If you do wish to have colors, in addition to passing the levels to the Logger itself, you must make winston aware of them:\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Make winston aware of these colors\n  //\n  winston.addColors(myCustomLevels.colors);\n```\n\nThis enables transports with the \'colorize\' option set to appropriately color the output of custom levels.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### Events and Callbacks in Winston\nEach instance of winston.Logger is also an instance of an [EventEmitter][1]. A log event will be raised each time a transport successfully logs a message:\n\n``` js\n  logger.on(\'logging\', function (transport, level, msg, meta) {\n    // [msg] and [meta] have now been logged at [level] to [transport]\n  });\n\n  logger.info(\'CHILL WINSTON!\', { seriously: true });\n```\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the logger also emits an \'error\' event which you should handle or suppress if you don\'t want unhandled exceptions:\n\n``` js\n  //\n  // Handle errors\n  //\n  logger.on(\'error\', function (err) { /* Do Something */ });\n\n  //\n  // Or just suppress them.\n  //\n  logger.emitErrs = false;\n```\n\nEvery logging method described in the previous section also takes an optional callback which will be called only when all of the transports have logged the specified message.\n\n``` js\n  logger.info(\'CHILL WINSTON!\', { seriously: true }, function (err, level, msg, meta) {\n    // [msg] and [meta] have now been logged at [level] to **every** transport.\n  });\n```\n\n### Working with multiple Loggers in winston\n\nOften in larger, more complex applications it is necessary to have multiple logger instances with different settings. Each logger is responsible for a different feature area (or category). This is exposed in `winston` in two ways: through `winston.loggers` and instances of `winston.Container`. In fact, `winston.loggers` is just a predefined instance of `winston.Container`:\n\n``` js\n  var winston = require(\'winston\');\n\n  //\n  // Configure the logger for `category1`\n  //\n  winston.loggers.add(\'category1\', {\n    console: {\n      level: \'silly\',\n      colorize: \'true\'\n    },\n    file: {\n      filename: \'/path/to/some/file\'\n    }\n  });\n\n  //\n  // Configure the logger for `category2`\n  //\n  winston.loggers.add(\'category2\', {\n    couchdb: {\n      host: \'127.0.0.1\',\n      port: 5984\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nNow that your loggers are setup you can require winston _in any file in your application_ and access these pre-configured loggers:\n\n``` js\n  var winston = require(\'winston\');\n\n  //\n  // Grab your preconfigured logger\n  //\n  var category1 = winston.loggers.get(\'category1\');\n\n  category1.info(\'logging from your IoC container-based logger\');\n```\n\nIf you prefer to manage the `Container` yourself you can simply instantiate one:\n\n``` js\n  var winston = require(\'winston\'),\n      container = new winston.Container();\n\n  container.add(\'category1\', {\n    console: {\n      level: \'silly\',\n      colorize: \'true\'\n    },\n    file: {\n      filename: \'/path/to/some/file\'\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n### Sharing transports between Loggers in winston\n\n``` js\n  var winston = require(\'winston\');\n\n  //\n  // Setup transports to be shared across all loggers\n  // in three ways:\n  //\n  // 1. By setting it on the default Container\n  // 2. By passing `transports` into the constructor function of winston.Container\n  // 3. By passing `transports` into the `.get()` or `.add()` methods\n  //\n\n  //\n  // 1. By setting it on the default Container\n  //\n  winston.loggers.options.transports = [\n    // Setup your shared transports here\n  ];\n\n  //\n  // 2. By passing `transports` into the constructor function of winston.Container\n  //\n  var container = new winston.Container({\n    transports: [\n      // Setup your shared transports here\n    ]\n  });\n\n  //\n  // 3. By passing `transports` into the `.get()` or `.add()` methods\n  //\n  winston.loggers.add(\'some-category\', {\n    transports: [\n      // Setup your shared transports here\n    ]\n  });\n\n  container.add(\'some-category\', {\n    transports: [\n      // Setup your shared transports here\n    ]\n  });\n```\n\n### Using winston in a CLI tool\nA common use-case for logging is output to a CLI tool. Winston has a special helper method which will pretty print output from your CLI tool. Here\'s an example from the [require-analyzer][2] written by [Nodejitsu][3]:\n\n```\n  info:   require-analyzer starting in /Users/Charlie/Nodejitsu/require-analyzer\n  info:   Found existing dependencies\n  data:   {\n  data:     colors: \'0.x.x\',\n  data:     eyes: \'0.1.x\',\n  data:     findit: \'0.0.x\',\n  data:     npm: \'1.0.x\',\n  data:     optimist: \'0.2.x\',\n  data:     semver: \'1.0.x\',\n  data:     winston: \'0.2.x\'\n  data:   }\n  info:   Analyzing dependencies...\n  info:   Done analyzing raw dependencies\n  info:   Retrieved packages from npm\n  warn:   No additional dependencies found\n```\n\nConfiguring output for this style is easy, just use the `.cli()` method on `winston` or an instance of `winston.Logger`:\n\n``` js\n  var winston = require(\'winston\');\n\n  //\n  // Configure CLI output on the default logger\n  //\n  winston.cli();\n\n  //\n  // Configure CLI on an instance of winston.Logger\n  //\n  var logger = new winston.Logger({\n    transports: [\n      new (winston.transports.Console)()\n    ]\n  });\n\n  logger.cli();\n```\n\n### Extending another object with Logging\nOften in a given code base with lots of Loggers it is useful to add logging methods a different object so that these methods can be called with less syntax. Winston exposes this functionality via the \'extend\' method:\n\n``` js\n  var myObject = {};\n\n  logger.extend(myObject);\n\n  //\n  // You can now call logger methods on \'myObject\'\n  //\n  myObject.info(\'127.0.0.1 - there\'s no place like home\');\n```\n\n## Working with Transports\nRight now there are four transports supported by winston core. If you have a transport you would like to add either open an issue or fork and submit a pull request. Commits are welcome, but I\'ll give you extra street cred if you __add tests too :D__\n   \n1. __Console:__ Output to the terminal\n2. __Files:__ Append to a file\n3. __Loggly:__ Log to Logging-as-a-Service platform Loggly\n\n### Console Transport\n``` js\n  winston.add(winston.transports.Console, options)\n```\n\nThe Console transport takes two simple options:\n\n* __level:__ Level of messages that this transport should log (default \'info\').\n* __silent:__ Boolean flag indicating whether to suppress output (default false).\n* __colorize:__ Boolean flag indicating if we should colorize output (default false).\n* __timestamp:__ Boolean flag indicating if we should prepend output with timestamps (default false). If function is specified, its return value will be used instead of timestamps.\n\n*Metadata:* Logged via util.inspect(meta);\n\n### File Transport\n``` js\n  winston.add(winston.transports.File, options)\n```\n\nThe File transport should really be the \'Stream\' transport since it will accept any [WritableStream][14]. It is named such because it will also accept filenames via the \'filename\' option:\n\n* __level:__ Level of messages that this transport should log.\n* __silent:__ Boolean flag indicating whether to suppress output.\n* __colorize:__ Boolean flag indicating if we should colorize output.\n* __timestamp:__ Boolean flag indicating if we should prepend output with timestamps (default true). If function is specified, its return value will be used instead of timestamps.\n* __filename:__ The filename of the logfile to write output to.\n* __maxsize:__ Max size in bytes of the logfile, if the size is exceeded then a new file is created.\n* __maxFiles:__ Limit the number of files created when the size of the logfile is exceeded.\n* __stream:__ The WriteableStream to write output to.\n* __json:__ If true, messages will be logged as JSON (default true).\n\n*Metadata:* Logged via util.inspect(meta);\n\n### Loggly Transport\n``` js\n  var Loggly = require(\'winston-loggly\').Loggly\n  winston.add(Loggly, options);\n```\n\nThe Loggly transport is based on [Nodejitsu\'s][5] [node-loggly][6] implementation of the [Loggly][7] API. If you haven\'t heard of Loggly before, you should probably read their [value proposition][8]. The Loggly transport takes the following options. Either \'inputToken\' or \'inputName\' is required:\n\n* __level:__ Level of messages that this transport should log. \n* __subdomain:__ The subdomain of your Loggly account. *[required]*\n* __auth__: The authentication information for your Loggly account. *[required with inputName]*\n* __inputName:__ The name of the input this instance should log to.\n* __inputToken:__ The input token of the input this instance should log to.\n* __json:__ If true, messages will be sent to Loggly as JSON.\n\n*Metadata:* Logged in suggested [Loggly format][2]\n\n### Riak Transport\nAs of `0.3.0` the Riak transport has been broken out into a new module: [winston-riak][17]. Using it is just as easy:\n\n``` js\n  var Riak = require(\'winston-riak\').Riak;\n  winston.add(Riak, options);\n```\n\nIn addition to the options accepted by the [riak-js][3] [client][4], the Riak transport also accepts the following options. It is worth noting that the riak-js debug option is set to *false* by default:\n\n* __level:__ Level of messages that this transport should log.\n* __bucket:__ The name of the Riak bucket you wish your logs to be in or a function to generate bucket names dynamically.\n\n``` js\n  // Use a single bucket for all your logs\n  var singleBucketTransport = new (Riak)({ bucket: \'some-logs-go-here\' });\n  \n  // Generate a dynamic bucket based on the date and level\n  var dynamicBucketTransport = new (Riak)({\n    bucket: function (level, msg, meta, now) {\n      var d = new Date(now);\n      return level + [d.getDate(), d.getMonth(), d.getFullYear()].join(\'-\');\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n*Metadata:* Logged as JSON literal in Riak\n\n### MongoDB Transport\nAs of `0.3.0` the MongoDB transport has been broken out into a new module: [winston-mongodb][16]. Using it is just as easy:\n\n``` js\n  var MongoDB = require(\'winston-mongodb\').MongoDB;\n  winston.add(MongoDB, options);\n```\n\nThe MongoDB transport takes the following options. \'db\' is required:\n\n* __level:__ Level of messages that this transport should log. \n* __silent:__ Boolean flag indicating whether to suppress output.\n* __db:__ The name of the database you want to log to. *[required]*\n* __collection__: The name of the collection you want to store log messages in, defaults to \'log\'.\n* __safe:__ Boolean indicating if you want eventual consistency on your log messages, if set to true it requires an extra round trip to the server to ensure the write was committed, defaults to true.\n* __host:__ The host running MongoDB, defaults to localhost.\n* __port:__ The port on the host that MongoDB is running on, defaults to MongoDB\'s default port.\n\n*Metadata:* Logged as a native JSON object.\n\n### SimpleDB Transport\n\nThe [winston-simpledb][18] transport is just as easy:\n\n``` js\n  var SimpleDB = require(\'winston-simpledb\').SimpleDB;\n  winston.add(SimpleDB, options);\n```\n\nThe SimpleDB transport takes the following options. All items marked with an asterisk are required:\n\n* __awsAccessKey__:* your AWS Access Key\n* __secretAccessKey__:* your AWS Secret Access Key\n* __awsAccountId__:* your AWS Account Id\n* __domainName__:* a string or function that returns the domain name to log to\n* __region__:* the region your domain resides in\n* __itemName__: a string (\'uuid\', \'epoch\', \'timestamp\') or function that returns the item name to log\n\n*Metadata:* Logged as a native JSON object to the \'meta\' attribute of the item.\n\n### Mail Transport\n\nThe [winston-mail][19] is an email transport:\n\n``` js\n  var Mail = require(\'winston-mail\').Mail;\n  winston.add(Mail, options);\n```\n\nThe Mail transport uses [emailjs](https://github.com/eleith/emailjs) behind the scenes.  Options are the following:\n\n* __to:__ The address(es) you want to send to. *[required]*\n* __from:__ The address you want to send from. (default: `winston@[server-host-name]`)\n* __host:__ SMTP server hostname (default: localhost)\n* __port:__ SMTP port (default: 587 or 25)\n* __username__ User for server auth\n* __password__ Password for server auth\n* __ssl:__ Use SSL (boolean or object { key, ca, cert })\n* __tls:__ Boolean (if true, use starttls)\n* __level:__ Level of messages that this transport should log. \n* __silent:__ Boolean flag indicating whether to suppress output.\n\n*Metadata:* Stringified as JSON in email.\n\n### Amazon SNS (Simple Notification System) Transport\n\nThe [winston-sns][21] transport uses amazon SNS to send emails, texts, or a bunch of other notifications.\n\n``` js\n  require(\'winston-sns\').SNS;\n  winston.add(winston.transports.SNS, options);\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n* __aws_key:__ Your Amazon Web Services Key. *[required]*\n* __aws_secret:__ Your Amazon Web Services Secret. *[required]*\n* __subscriber:__ Subscriber number - found in your SNS AWS Console, after clicking on a topic. Same as AWS Account ID. *[required]*\n* __topic_arn:__ Also found in SNS AWS Console - listed under a topic as Topic ARN. *[required]*\n* __region:__ AWS Region to use. Can be one of: `us-east-1`,`us-west-1`,`eu-west-1`,`ap-southeast-1`,`ap-northeast-1`,`us-gov-west-1`,`sa-east-1`. (default: `us-east-1`)\n* __subject:__ Subject for notifications. (default: "Winston Error Report")\n* __message:__ Message of notifications. Uses placeholders for level (%l), error message (%e), and metadata (%m). (default: "Level \'%l\' Error:\\n%e\\n\\nMetadata:\\n%m")\n* __level:__ lowest level this transport will log. (default: `info`)\n\n### Graylog2 Transport\n\n[winston-graylog2][22] is a Graylog2 transport:\n\n``` js\n  var Graylog2 = require(\'winston-graylog2\').Graylog2;\n  winston.add(Graylog2, options);\n```\n\nThe Graylog2 transport connects to a Graylog2 server over UDP using the following options:\n\n* __level:__ Level of messages this transport should log. (default: info)\n* __silent:__ Boolean flag indicating whether to suppress output. (default: false)\n\n* __graylogHost:__ IP address or hostname of the graylog2 server. (default: localhost)\n* __graylogPort:__ Port to send messages to on the graylog2 server. (default: 12201)\n* __graylogHostname:__ The hostname associated with graylog2 messages. (default: require(\'os\').hostname())\n* __graylogFacility:__ The graylog2 facility to send log messages.. (default: nodejs)\n\n*Metadata:* Stringified as JSON in the full message GELF field.\n\n### Adding Custom Transports\nAdding a custom transport (say for one of the datastore on the Roadmap) is actually pretty easy. All you need to do is accept a couple of options, set a name, implement a log() method, and add it to the set of transports exposed by winston.\n\n``` js\n  var util = require(\'util\'),\n      winston = require(\'winston\');\n\n  var CustomLogger = winston.transports.CustomerLogger = function (options) {\n    //\n    // Name this logger\n    //\n    this.name = \'customLogger\';\n\n    //\n    // Set the level from your options\n    //\n    this.level = options.level || \'info\';\n\n    //\n    // Configure your storage backing as you see fit\n    //\n  };\n\n  //\n  // Inherit from `winston.Transport` so you can take advantage\n  // of the base functionality and `.handleExceptions()`.\n  //\n  util.inherits(CustomLogger, winston.Transport);\n\n  CustomLogger.prototype.log = function (level, msg, meta, callback) {\n    //\n    // Store this message and metadata, maybe use some custom logic\n    // then callback indicating success.\n    //\n    callback(null, true);\n  };\n```\n\n### Inspirations\n1.

48976 silly resolved     readme: '## read\n\nFor reading user input from stdin.\n\nSimilar to the `readline` builtin\'s `question()` method, but with a\nfew more features.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\nvar read = require("read")\nread(options, callback)\n```\n\nThe callback gets called with either the user input, or the default\nspecified, or an error, as `callback(error, result, isDefault)`\nnode style.\n\n## OPTIONS\n\nEvery option is optional.\n\n* `prompt` What to write to stdout before reading input.\n* `silent` Don\'t echo the output as the user types it.\n* `replace` Replace silenced characters with the supplied character value.\n* `timeout` Number of ms to wait for user input before giving up.\n* `default` The default value if the user enters nothing.\n* `edit` Allow the user to edit the default value.\n* `terminal` Treat the output as a TTY, whether it is or not.\n* `input` Readable stream to get input data from. (default `process.stdin`)\n* `output` Writeable stream to write prompts to. (default: `process.stdout`)\n\nIf silent is true, and the input is a TTY, then read will set raw\nmode, and read character by character.\n\n## COMPATIBILITY\n\nThis module works sort of with node 0.6.  It does not work with node\nversions less than 0.6.  It is best on node 0.8.\n\nOn node version 0.6, it will remove all listeners on the input\nstream\'s `data` and `keypress` events, because the readline module did\nnot fully clean up after itself in that version of node, and did not\nmake it possible to clean up after it in a way that has no potential\nfor side effects.\n\nAdditionally, some of the readline options (like `terminal`) will not\nfunction in versions of node before 0.8, because they were not\nimplemented in the builtin readline module.\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nPatches welcome.\n',

48976 silly resolved     readme: '# revalidator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/flatiron/revalidator.png)](http://travis-ci.org/flatiron/revalidator)\n\nA cross-browser / node.js validator used by resourceful and flatiron.\n\n## Example\nThe core of `revalidator` is simple and succinct: `revalidator.validate(obj, schema)`: \n \n``` js\n  var revalidator = require(\'revalidator\');\n  \n  console.dir(revalidator.validate(someObject, {\n    properties: {\n      url: {\n        description: \'the url the object should be stored at\',\n        type: \'string\',\n        pattern: \'^/[^#%&*{}\\\\:<>?\\/+]+$\',\n        required: true\n      },\n      challenge: {\n        description: \'a means of protecting data (insufficient for production, used as example)\',\n        type: \'string\',\n        minLength: 5\n      },\n      body: {\n        description: \'what to store at the url\',\n        type: \'any\',\n        default: null\n      }\n    }\n  }));\n```\n\nThis will return with a value indicating if the `obj` conforms to the `schema`. If it does not, a descriptive object will be returned containing the errors encountered with validation.\n\n``` js\n  {\n    valid: true // or false\n    errors: [/* Array of errors if valid is false */]\n  }\n```\n\nIn the browser, the validation function is exposed on `window.validate` by simply including `revalidator.js`.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing npm (node package manager)\n``` bash\n  $ curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### Installing revalidator\n``` bash \n  $ [sudo] npm install revalidator\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n`revalidator` takes json-schema as input to validate objects.\n\n### revalidator.validate (obj, schema, options)\n\nThis will return with a value indicating if the `obj` conforms to the `schema`. If it does not, a descriptive object will be returned containing the errors encountered with validation.\n\n``` js\n{\n  valid: true // or false\n  errors: [/* Array of errors if valid is false */]\n}\n```\n\n#### Available Options\n\n* __validateFormats__: Enforce format constraints (_default true_)\n* __validateFormatsStrict__: When `validateFormats` is _true_ treat unrecognized formats as validation errors (_default false_)\n* __validateFormatExtensions__: When `validateFormats` is _true_ also validate formats defined in `validate.formatExtensions` (_default true_)\n* __cast__: Enforce casting of some types (for integers/numbers are only supported) when it\'s possible, e.g. `"42" => 42`, but `"forty2" => "forty2"` for the `integer` type.\n\n### Schema\nFor a property an `value` is that which is given as input for validation where as an `expected value` is the value of the below fields\n\n#### required\nIf true, the value should not be empty\n\n```js\n{ required: true }\n```\n\n#### type\nThe `type of value` should be equal to the expected value\n\n```js\n{ type: \'string\' }\n{ type: \'number\' }\n{ type: \'integer\' }\n{ type: \'array\' }\n{ type: \'boolean\' }\n{ type: \'object\' }\n{ type: \'null\' }\n{ type: \'any\' }\n{ type: [\'boolean\', \'string\'] }\n```\n\n#### pattern\nThe expected value regex needs to be satisfied by the value\n\n```js\n{ pattern: /^[a-z]+$/ }\n```\n\n#### maxLength\nThe length of value must be greater than or equal to expected value\n\n```js\n{ maxLength: 8 }\n```\n\n#### minLength\nThe length of value must be lesser than or equal to expected value\n\n```js\n{ minLength: 8 }\n```\n\n#### minimum\nValue must be greater than or equal to the expected value\n\n```js\n{ minimum: 10 }\n```\n\n#### maximum\nValue must be lesser than or equal to the expected value\n\n```js\n{ maximum: 10 }\n```\n\n#### exclusiveMinimum\nValue must be greater than expected value\n\n```js\n{ exclusiveMinimum: 9 }\n```\n\n### exclusiveMaximum\nValue must be lesser than expected value\n\n```js\n{ exclusiveMaximum: 11 }\n```\n\n#### divisibleBy\nValue must be divisible by expected value\n\n```js\n{ divisibleBy: 5 }\n{ divisibleBy: 0.5 }\n```\n\n#### minItems\nValue must contain more then expected value number of items\n\n```js\n{ minItems: 2 }\n```\n\n#### maxItems\nValue must contains less then expected value number of items\n\n```js\n{ maxItems: 5 }\n```\n\n#### uniqueItems\nValue must hold a unique set of values\n\n```js\n{ uniqueItems: true }\n```\n\n#### enum\nValue must be present in the array of expected value\n\n```js\n{ enum: [\'month\', \'year\'] }\n```\n\n#### format\nValue must be a valid format\n\n```js\n{ format: \'url\' }\n{ format: \'email\' }\n{ format: \'ip-address\' }\n{ format: \'ipv6\' }\n{ format: \'date-time\' }\n{ format: \'date\' }\n{ format: \'time\' }\n{ format: \'color\' }\n{ format: \'host-name\' }\n{ format: \'utc-millisec\' }\n{ format: \'regex\' }\n```\n\n#### conform\nValue must conform to constraint denoted by expected value\n\n```js\n{ conform: function (v) {\n    if (v%3==1) return true;\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### dependencies\nValue is valid only if the dependent value is valid\n\n```js\n{\n  town: { required: true, dependencies: \'country\' },\n  country: { maxLength: 3, required: true }\n}\n```\n\n### Nested Schema\nWe also allow nested schema\n\n```js\n{\n  properties: {\n    title: {\n      type: \'string\',\n      maxLength: 140,\n      required: true\n    },\n    author: {\n      type: \'object\',\n      required: true,\n      properties: {\n        name: {\n          type: \'string\',\n          required: true\n        },\n        email: {\n          type: \'string\',\n          format: \'email\'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Messages\nWe also allow custom message for different constraints\n\n```js\n{\n  type: \'string\',\n  format: \'url\'\n  messages: {\n    type: \'Not a string type\',\n    format: \'Expected format is a url\'\n  }\n```\n\n```js\n{\n  conform: function () { ... },\n  message: \'This can be used as a global message\'\n}\n```\n\n## Tests\nAll tests are written with [vows][0] and should be run with [npm][1]:\n\n``` bash\n  $ npm test\n```\n\n#### Author: [Charlie Robbins](http://nodejitsu.com), [Alexis Sellier](http://cloudhead.io)\n#### Contributors: [Fedor Indutny](http://github.com/indutny), [Bradley Meck](http://github.com/bmeck), [Laurie Harper](http://laurie.holoweb.net/)\n#### License: Apache 2.0\n\n[0]: http://vowsjs.org\n[1]: http://npmjs.org\n',

49028 silly resolved     readme: '# EventStream\n\n[Streams](http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html "Stream") are nodes best and most misunderstood idea, and \n_<em>EventStream</em>_ is a toolkit to make creating and working with streams <em>easy</em>.  \n\nNormally, streams are only used of IO,  \nbut in event stream we send all kinds of objects down the pipe.  \nIf your application\'s <em>input</em> and <em>output</em> are streams,  \nshouldn\'t the <em>throughput</em> be a stream too?  \n\nThe *EventStream* functions resemble the array functions,  \nbecause Streams are like Arrays, but laid out in time, rather than in memory.  \n\n<em>All the `event-stream` functions return instances of `Stream`</em>.\n\nStream API docs: [nodejs.org/api/streams](http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html "Stream")\n\nNOTE: I shall use the term <em>"through stream"</em> to refer to a stream that is writable <em>and</em> readable.  \n\n###[simple example](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/blob/master/examples/pretty.js):\n\n``` js\n\n//pretty.js\n\nif(!module.parent) {\n  var es = require(\'event-stream\')\n  es.connect(                         //connect streams together with `pipe`\n    process.openStdin(),              //open stdin\n    es.split(),                       //split stream to break on newlines\n    es.map(function (data, callback) {//turn this async function into a stream\n      callback(null\n        , inspect(JSON.parse(data)))  //render it nicely\n    }),\n    process.stdout                    // pipe it to stdout !\n    )\n  }\n```\nrun it ...\n\n``` bash  \ncurl -sS registry.npmjs.org/event-stream | node pretty.js\n```\n \n[test are in event-stream_tests](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream_tests)\n\n[node Stream documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html)\n\n##map (asyncFunction)\n\nCreate a through stream from an asyncronous function.  \n\n``` js\nvar es = require(\'event-stream\')\n\nes.map(function (data, callback) {\n  //transform data\n  // ...\n  callback(null, data)\n})\n\n```\n\nEach map MUST call the callback. It may callback with data, with an error or with no arguments, \n\n  * `callback()` drop this data.  \n    this makes the map work like `filter`,  \n    note:`callback(null,null)` is not the same, and will emit `null`\n\n  * `callback(null, newData)` turn data into newData\n    \n  * `callback(error)` emit an error for this item.\n\n>Note: if a callback is not called, `map` will think that it is still being processed,   \n>every call must be answered or the stream will not know when to end.  \n>\n>Also, if the callback is called more than once, every call but the first will be ignored.\n\n##readable (asyncFunction) \n\ncreate a readable stream (that respects pause) from an async function.  \nwhile the stream is not paused,  \nthe function will be polled with `(count, callback)`,  \nand `this`  will be the readable stream.\n\n``` js\n\nes.readable(function (count, callback) {\n  if(streamHasEnded)\n    return this.emit(\'end\')\n  \n  //...\n  \n  this.emit(\'data\', data) //use this way to emit multiple chunks per call.\n      \n  callback() // you MUST always call the callback eventually.\n             // the function will not be called again until you do this.\n})\n```\nyou can also pass the data and the error to the callback.  \nyou may only call the callback once.  \ncalling the same callback more than once will have no effect.  \n\n##readArray (array)\n\nCreate a readable stream from an Array.\n\nJust emit each item as a data event, respecting `pause` and `resume`.\n\n``` js\n  var es = require(\'event-stream\')\n    , reader = es.readArray([1,2,3])\n\n  reader.pipe(...)\n```\n\n## writeArray (callback)\n\ncreate a writeable stream from a callback,  \nall `data` events are stored in an array, which is passed to the callback when the stream ends.\n\n``` js\n  var es = require(\'event-stream\')\n    , reader = es.readArray([1, 2, 3])\n    , writer = es.writeArray(function (err, array){\n      //array deepEqual [1, 2, 3]\n    })\n\n  reader.pipe(writer)\n```\n\n## split ()\n\nBreak up a stream and reassemble it so that each line is a chunk.  \n\nExample, read every line in a file ...\n\n``` js\n  es.connect(\n    fs.createReadStream(file, {flags: \'r\'}),\n    es.split(),\n    es.map(function (line, cb) {\n       //do something with the line \n       cb(null, line)\n    })\n  )\n\n```\n\n## connect (stream1,...,streamN)\n\nConnect multiple Streams together into one stream.  \n`connect` will return a Stream. This stream will write to the first stream,\nand will emit data from the last stream. \n\nListening for \'error\' will recieve errors from all streams inside the pipe.\n\n``` js\n\n  es.connect(                         //connect streams together with `pipe`\n    process.openStdin(),              //open stdin\n    es.split(),                       //split stream to break on newlines\n    es.map(function (data, callback) {//turn this async function into a stream\n      callback(null\n        , inspect(JSON.parse(data)))  //render it nicely\n    }),\n    process.stdout                    // pipe it to stdout !\n    )\n```\n\n## gate (isShut=true) \n\nIf the gate is `shut`, buffer the stream.  \nAll calls to write will return false (pause upstream),  \nand end will not be sent downstream.  \n\nIf the gate is open, let the stream through.  \n\nNamed `shut` instead of close, because close is already kinda meaningful with streams.  \n\nGate is useful for holding off processing a stream until some resource (i.e. a database, or network connection) is ready.  \n\n``` js\n\n  var gate = es.gate()\n  \n  gate.open() //allow the gate to stream\n  \n  gate.close() //buffer the stream, also do not allow \'end\' \n\n```\n\n## duplex\n\nTakes a writable stream and a readable stream and makes them appear as a readable writable stream.\n\nIt is assumed that the two streams are connected to each other in some way.  \n\n(This is used by `connect` and `child`.)\n\n``` js\n  var grep = cp.exec(\'grep Stream\')\n\n  es.duplex(grep.stdin, grep.stdout)\n```\n\n## child (child_process)\n\nCreate a through stream from a child process ...\n\n``` js\n  var cp = require(\'child_process\')\n\n  es.child(cp.exec(\'grep Stream\')) // a through stream\n\n```\n\n## pipeable (streamCreatorFunction,...)\n\nThe arguments to pipable must be functions that return  \ninstances of Stream or async functions.  \n(If a function is returned, it will be turned into a Stream  \nwith `es.map`.)\n\nHere is the first example rewritten to use `pipeable`.\n\n``` js\n//examples/pretty_pipeable.js\nvar inspect = require(\'util\').inspect\n\nif(!module.parent)\n  require(\'event-stream\').pipeable(function () {\n    return function (data, callback) {\n      try {\n        data = JSON.parse(data)\n      } catch (err) {}              //pass non JSON straight through!\n      callback(null, inspect(data))\n      }\n    })  \n  })\n```\n\n``` bash\n\ncurl -sS registry.npmjs.org/event-stream | node pipeable_pretty.js\n\n## or, turn the pipe into a server!\n\nnode pipeable_pretty.js --port 4646\n\ncurl -sS registry.npmjs.org/event-stream | curl -sSNT- localhost:4646\n\n```\n## compatible modules:\n\n  *

49277 silly resolved     readme: '# EventEmitter2\n\nEventEmitter2 is a an implementation of the EventEmitter found in Node.js\n\n## Features\n\n - Namespaces/Wildcards.\n - Times To Listen (TTL), extends the `once` concept with `many`.\n - Browser environment compatibility.\n - Demonstrates good performance in benchmarks\n\n```\nEventEmitterHeatUp x 3,728,965 ops/sec \\302\\2610.68% (60 runs sampled)\nEventEmitter x 2,822,904 ops/sec \\302\\2610.74% (63 runs sampled)\nEventEmitter2 x 7,251,227 ops/sec \\302\\2610.55% (58 runs sampled)\nEventEmitter2 (wild) x 3,220,268 ops/sec \\302\\2610.44% (65 runs sampled)\nFastest is EventEmitter2\n```\n\n## Differences (Non breaking, compatible with existing EventEmitter)\n\n - The constructor takes a configuration object.\n \n```javascript\n    var EventEmitter2 = require(\'eventemitter2\').EventEmitter2;\n    var server = new EventEmitter2({\n      wildcard: true, // should the event emitter use wildcards.\n      delimiter: \'::\', // the delimiter used to segment namespaces, defaults to `.`.\n      newListener: false, // if you want to emit the newListener event set to true.\n      maxListeners: 20, // the max number of listeners that can be assigned to an event, defaults to 10.\n    });\n```\n\n - Getting the actual event that fired.\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'foo.*\', function(value1, value2) {\n      console.log(this.event, value1, value2);\n    });\n```\n\n - Fire an event N times and then remove it, an extension of the `once` concept.\n\n```javascript\n    server.many(\'foo\', 4, function() {\n      console.log(\'hello\');\n    });\n```\n\n - Pass in a namespaced event as an array rather than a delimited string.\n\n```javascript\n    server.many([\'foo\', \'bar\', \'bazz\'], function() {\n      console.log(\'hello\');\n    });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\nWhen an `EventEmitter` instance experiences an error, the typical action is\nto emit an `error` event. Error events are treated as a special case.\nIf there is no listener for it, then the default action is to print a stack\ntrace and exit the program.\n\nAll EventEmitters emit the event `newListener` when new listeners are\nadded.\n\n\n**Namespaces** with **Wildcards**\nTo use namespaces/wildcards, pass the `wildcard` option into the EventEmitter constructor.\nWhen namespaces/wildcards are enabled, events can either be strings (`foo.bar`) separated\nby a delimiter or arrays (`[\'foo\', \'bar\']`). The delimiter is also configurable as a \nconstructor option.\n\nAn event name passed to any event emitter method can contain a wild card (the `*` character).\nIf the event name is a string, a wildcard may appear as `foo.*`. If the event name is an array, \nthe wildcard may appear as `[\'foo\', \'*\']`.\n\nIf either of the above described events were passed to the `on` method, subsequent emits such \nas the following would be observed...\n\n```javascript\n   emitter.emit(\'foo.bazz\');\n   emitter.emit([\'foo\', \'bar\']);\n```\n\n\n#### emitter.addListener(event, listener)\n#### emitter.on(event, listener)\n\nAdds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'data\', function(value1, value2, value3 /* accepts any number of expected values... */) {\n      console.log(\'The event was raised!\');\n    });\n```\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'data\', function(value) {\n      console.log(\'The event was raised!\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.onAny(listener)\n\nAdds a listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.\n\n```javascript\n    server.onAny(function(value) {\n      console.log(\'All events trigger this.\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.offAny(listener)\n\nRemoves the listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.\n\n```javascript\n    server.offAny(function(value) {\n      console.log(\'The event was raised!\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.once(event, listener)\n\nAdds a **one time** listener for the event. The listener is invoked only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.\n\n```javascript\n    server.once(\'get\', function (value) {\n      console.log(\'Ah, we have our first value!\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.many(event, timesToListen, listener)\n\nAdds a listener that will execute **n times** for the event before being removed. The listener is invoked only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.\n\n```javascript\n    server.many(\'get\', 4, function (value) {\n      console.log(\'This event will be listened to exactly four times.\');\n    });\n```\n\n\n#### emitter.removeListener(event, listener)\n#### emitter.off(event, listener)\n\nRemove a listener from the listener array for the specified event. **Caution**: changes array indices in the listener array behind the listener.\n\n```javascript\n    var callback = function(value) {\n      console.log(\'someone connected!\');\n    };\n    server.on(\'get\', callback);\n    // ...\n    server.removeListener(\'get\', callback);\n```\n\n\n#### emitter.removeAllListeners([event])\n\nRemoves all listeners, or those of the specified event.\n\n\n#### emitter.setMaxListeners(n)\n\nBy default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added to it. This is a useful default which helps finding memory leaks. Obviously not all Emitters should be limited to 10. This function allows that to be increased. Set to zero for unlimited.\n\n\n#### emitter.listeners(event)\n\nReturns an array of listeners for the specified event. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'get\', function(value) {\n      console.log(\'someone connected!\');\n    });\n    console.log(console.log(server.listeners(\'get\')); // [ [Function] ]\n```\n\n#### emitter.listenersAny()\n\nReturns an array of listeners that are listening for any event that is specified. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.\n\n```javascript\n    server.onAny(function(value) {\n      console.log(\'someone connected!\');\n    });\n    console.log(console.log(server.listenersAny()[0]); // [ [Function] ] // someone connected!\n```\n\n#### emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...])\n\nExecute each of the listeners that may be listening for the specified event name in order with the list of arguments.\n\n## Test coverage\n\nThere is a test suite that tries to cover each use case, it can be found <a href="https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2/tree/master/test">here</a>.\n\n## Licence\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 hij1nx <http://www.twitter.com/hij1nx>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

49552 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser.\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, forEach…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n    async.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n        // results is now an array of stats for each file\n    });\n\n    async.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n        // results now equals an array of the existing files\n    });\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(){ ... },\n        function(){ ... }\n    ], callback);\n\n    async.series([\n        function(){ ... },\n        function(){ ... }\n    ]);\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n\n## Download\n\nReleases are available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async/downloads).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n    npm install async\n\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 17.5kb Uncompressed\n\n__Production:__ [async.min.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/dist/async.min.js) - 1.7kb Packed and Gzipped\n\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far its been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. Usage:\n\n    <script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n    <script type="text/javascript">\n\n        async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n            alert(results);\n        });\n\n    </script>\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [forEach](#forEach)\n* [map](#map)\n* [filter](#filter)\n* [reject](#reject)\n* [reduce](#reduce)\n* [detect](#detect)\n* [sortBy](#sortBy)\n* [some](#some)\n* [every](#every)\n* [concat](#concat)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [series](#series)\n* [parallel](#parallel)\n* [whilst](#whilst)\n* [until](#until)\n* [waterfall](#waterfall)\n* [queue](#queue)\n* [auto](#auto)\n* [iterator](#iterator)\n* [apply](#apply)\n* [nextTick](#nextTick)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [memoize](#memoize)\n* [unmemoize](#unmemoize)\n* [log](#log)\n* [dir](#dir)\n* [noConflict](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n### forEach(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies an iterator function to each item in an array, in parallel.\nThe iterator is called with an item from the list and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main\ncallback for the forEach function is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n    // to save the modified contents of that file:\n\n    async.forEach(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n### forEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as forEach only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n### forEachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as forEach only the iterator is applied to batches of items in the\narray, in series. The next batch of iterators is only called once the current\none has completed processing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* limit - How many items should be in each batch.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n    // function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\n    async.forEachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n    });\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in the given array through\nthe iterator function. The iterator is called with an item from the array and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. The callback takes 2 arguments, \nan error and the transformed item from the array. If the iterator passes an\nerror to this callback, the main callback for the map function is immediately\ncalled with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order, however\nthe results array will be in the same order as the original array.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n        // results is now an array of stats for each file\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as map only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ select\n\nReturns a new array of all the values which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n        // results now equals an array of the existing files\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__alias:__ selectSeries\n\nThe same as filter only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of filter. Removes values that pass an async truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as filter, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__aliases:__ inject, foldl\n\nReduces a list of values into a single value using an async iterator to return\neach successive step. Memo is the initial state of the reduction. This\nfunction only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to\nsplit a call to this function into a parallel map, then use the normal\nArray.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where\neach step in the reduction needs to be async, if you can get the data before\nreducing it then its probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* memo - The initial state of the reduction.\n* iterator(memo, item, callback) - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iterator is passed a\n  callback which accepts an optional error as its first argument, and the state\n  of the reduction as the second. If an error is passed to the callback, the\n  reduction is stopped and the main callback is immediately called with the\n  error.\n* callback(err, result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n        // pointless async:\n        process.nextTick(function(){\n            callback(null, memo + item)\n        });\n    }, function(err, result){\n        // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ foldr\n\nSame as reduce, only operates on the items in the array in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in a list that passes an async truth test. The\niterator is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return true will\nfire the detect callback with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original array (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original array is important then look at detectSeries.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value undefined if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as detect, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original array (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each value through an async iterator.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and a value to use as the sort criteria.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is the items from\n  the original array sorted by the values returned by the iterator calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n        fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n            callback(err, stats.mtime);\n        });\n    }, function(err, results){\n        // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n        // modified date\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ any\n\nReturns true if at least one element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. Once any iterator\ncall returns true, the main callback is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either true or false depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ all\n\nReturns true if every element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on\n  the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.every([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // if result is true then every file exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concat" />\n### concat(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies an iterator to each item in a list, concatenating the results. Returns the\nconcatenated list. The iterators are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of the arguments passed to the iterator function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and an array of results.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the iterator function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n        // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as async.concat, but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run and the callback for the series is\nimmediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed,\nthe results are passed to the final callback as an array.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.series.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a callback it must call on completion.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets an array of all the arguments passed to\n  the callbacks used in the array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            // do some stuff ...\n            callback(null, \'one\');\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // do some more stuff ...\n            callback(null, \'two\');\n        },\n    ],\n    // optional callback\n    function(err, results){\n        // results is now equal to [\'one\', \'two\']\n    });\n\n\n    // an example using an object instead of an array\n    async.series({\n        one: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 1);\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        two: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 2);\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    },\n    function(err, results) {\n        // results is now equal to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallel" />\n### parallel(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous\nfunction has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its\ncallback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error.\nOnce the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an\narray.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.parallel.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed a\n  callback it must call on completion.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets an array of all the arguments passed to\n  the callbacks used in the array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, \'one\');\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, \'two\');\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    ],\n    // optional callback\n    function(err, results){\n        // the results array will equal [\'one\',\'two\'] even though\n        // the second function had a shorter timeout.\n    });\n\n\n    // an example using an object instead of an array\n    async.parallel({\n        one: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 1);\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        two: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 2);\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    },\n    function(err, results) {\n        // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="whilst" />\n### whilst(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, while test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* test() - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn.\n* fn(callback) - A function to call each time the test passes. The function is\n  passed a callback which must be called once it has completed with an optional\n  error as the first argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated\n  execution of fn has stopped.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var count = 0;\n\n    async.whilst(\n        function () { return count < 5; },\n        function (callback) {\n            count++;\n            setTimeout(callback, 1000);\n        },\n        function (err) {\n            // 5 seconds have passed\n        }\n    );\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="until" />\n### until(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, until test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\nThe inverse of async.whilst.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns an array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the functions pass an error to the callback, the\nnext function is not executed and the main callback is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback it\n  must call on completion.\n* callback(err, [results]) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.waterfall([\n        function(callback){\n            callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n        },\n        function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n            callback(null, \'three\');\n        },\n        function(arg1, callback){\n            // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n            callback(null, \'done\');\n        }\n    ], function (err, result) {\n       // result now equals \'done\'    \n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a queue object with the specified concurrency. Tasks added to the\nqueue will be processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit). If all\nworkers are in progress, the task is queued until one is available. Once\na worker has completed a task, the task\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* worker(task, callback) - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task.\n* concurrency - An integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe queue object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* length() - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* concurrency - an integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a queue is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* push(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the queue, the callback is called\n  once the worker has finished processing the task.\n  instead of a single task, an array of tasks can be submitted. the respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* saturated - a callback that is called when the queue length hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued\n* empty - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue is given to a worker\n* drain - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue has returned from the worker\n\n__Example__\n\n    // create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\n    var q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n        console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n        callback();\n    }, 2);\n\n\n    // assign a callback\n    q.drain = function() {\n        console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n    }\n\n    // add some items to the queue\n\n    q.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n    });\n    q.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n    });\n\n    // add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\n    q.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running functions based on their requirements.\nEach function can optionally depend on other functions being completed first,\nand each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. If any of\nthe functions pass an error to their callback, that function will not complete\n(so any other functions depending on it will not run) and the main callback\nwill be called immediately with the error. Functions also receive an object\ncontaining the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An object literal containing named functions or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The key\n  used for each function or array is used when specifying requirements. The\n  syntax is easier to understand by looking at the example.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. The callback will receive an error as an argument\n  if any tasks pass an error to their callback. If all tasks complete\n  successfully, it will receive an object containing their results.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.auto({\n        get_data: function(callback){\n            // async code to get some data\n        },\n        make_folder: function(callback){\n            // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n            // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        },\n        write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback){\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            callback(null, filename);\n        }],\n        email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        }]\n    });\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            // async code to get some data\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n            // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        }\n    ],\n    function(results){\n        async.series([\n            function(callback){\n                // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n                // write the data to a file in the directory\n            },\n            email_link: function(callback){\n                // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            }\n        ]);\n    });\n\nFor a complicated series of async tasks using the auto function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier and makes the code more readable.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. Its also possible to\n\'peek\' the next iterator by doing iterator.next().\n\nThis function is used internally by the async module but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback it\n  must call on completion.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var iterator = async.iterator([\n        function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n        function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n        function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n    ]);\n\n    node> var iterator2 = iterator();\n    \'one\'\n    node> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n    \'two\'\n    node> iterator3();\n    \'three\'\n    node> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\n    node> nextfn();\n    \'three\'\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied, a useful\nshorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // using apply\n\n    async.parallel([\n        async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n        async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n    ]);\n\n\n    // the same process without using apply\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n        },\n    ]);\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n    node> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\n    node> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\n    one\n    two\n    three\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls the callback on a later loop around the event loop. In node.js this just\ncalls process.nextTick, in the browser it falls back to setTimeout(callback, 0),\nwhich means other higher priority events may precede the execution of the callback.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* callback - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var call_order = [];\n    async.nextTick(function(){\n        call_order.push(\'two\');\n        // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two]\n    });\n    call_order.push(\'one\')\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the function you to proxy and cache results from.\n* hasher - an optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results, it has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n        // do something\n        callback(null, result);\n    };\n    var fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n    // fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\n    fn(\'some name\', function () {\n        // callback\n    });\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a memoized function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Comes handy in tests.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.log and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.log is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var hello = function(name, callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n        }, 1000);\n    };\n\n    node> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n    \'hello world\'\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console using console.dir to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.dir and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.dir is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var hello = function(name, callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, {hello: name});\n        }, 1000);\n    };\n\n    node> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n    {hello: \'world\'}\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of async back to its original value, returning a reference to the\nasync object.\n',

49552 silly resolved     readme: 'A `rm -rf` for node.\n\nInstall with `npm install rimraf`, or just drop rimraf.js somewhere.\n\n## API\n\n`rimraf(f, [options,] callback)`\n\nThe callback will be called with an error if there is one.  Certain\nerrors are handled for you:\n\n* `EBUSY` -  rimraf will back off a maximum of opts.maxBusyTries times\n  before giving up.\n* `EMFILE` - If too many file descriptors get opened, rimraf will\n  patiently wait until more become available.\n\n## Options\n\nThe options object is optional.  These fields are respected:\n\n* `maxBusyTries` -  The number of times to retry a file or folder in the\n  event of an `EBUSY` error.  The default is 3.\n* `gently` - If provided a `gently` path, then rimraf will only delete\n  files and folders that are beneath this path, and only delete symbolic\n  links that point to a place within this path.  (This is very important\n  to npm\'s use-case, and shows rimraf\'s pedigree.)\n\n\n## rimraf.sync\n\nIt can remove stuff synchronously, too.  But that\'s not so good.  Use\nthe async API.  It\'s better.\n',

49552 silly resolved     readme: '# ncp - Asynchronous recursive file & directory copying\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AvianFlu/ncp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/AvianFlu/ncp)\n\nThink `cp -r`, but pure node, and asynchronous.  `ncp` can be used both as a CLI tool and programmatically.\n\n## Command Line usage\n\nUsage is simple: `ncp [source] [dest] [--limit=concurrency limit]\n[--filter=filter] --stopOnErr`\n\nThe \'filter\' is a Regular Expression - matched files will be copied.\n\nThe \'concurrency limit\' is an integer that represents how many pending file system requests `ncp` has at a time.\n\n\'stopOnErr\' is a boolean flag that will tell `ncp` to stop immediately if any\nerrors arise, rather than attempting to continue while logging errors.\n\nIf there are no errors, `ncp` will output `done.` when complete.  If there are errors, the error messages will be logged to `stdout` and to `./ncp-debug.log`, and the copy operation will attempt to continue.\n\n## Programmatic usage\n\nProgrammatic usage of `ncp` is just as simple.  The only argument to the completion callback is a possible error.  \n\n```javascript\nvar ncp = require(\'ncp\').ncp;\n\nncp.limit = 16;\n\nncp(source, destination, function (err) {\n if (err) {\n   return console.error(err);\n }\n console.log(\'done!\');\n});\n```\n\nYou can also call ncp like `ncp(source, destination, options, callback)`. \n`options` should be a dictionary. Currently, such options are available:\n\n  * `options.filter` - a `RegExp` instance, against which each file name is\n  tested to determine whether to copy it or not, or a function taking single\n  parameter: copied file name, returning `true` or `false`, determining\n  whether to copy file or not.\n\nPlease open an issue if any bugs arise.  As always, I accept (working) pull requests, and refunds are available at `/dev/null`.\n',

49734 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

Just email me or more preferably open an issue.\n\n#### Problems\n\nWe lose two things for `include` and `reverse` methods from `_.string`:\n\n* Calls like `_(\'foobar\').include(\'bar\')` aren\'t available;\n* Chaining isn\'t available too.\n\nBut if you need this functionality you can create aliases for conflict functions which will be convenient for you:\n\n```javascript\n_.mixin({\n    includeString: _.str.include,\n    reverseString: _.str.reverse\n})\n\n// Now wrapper calls and chaining are available.\n_(\'foobar\').chain().reverseString().includeString(\'rab\').value()\n```\n\n#### Standalone Usage\n\nIf you are using Underscore.string without Underscore. You also have `_.string` namespace for it and `_.str` alias\nBut of course you can just reassign `_` variable with `_.string`\n\n```javascript\n_ = _.string\n```\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n### 2.3.3 ###\n\n* Add `toBoolean`\n* Add `unquote`\n* Add quote char option to `quote`\n* Support dash-separated words in `titleize`\n\n### 2.3.2 ###\n\n* Add `naturalCmp`\n* Bug fix to `camelize`\n* Add ă, ș, ț and ś to `slugify`\n* Doc updates\n* Add support for [component](http://component.io/)\n* [Full changelog](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2)\n\n### 2.3.1 ###\n\n* Bug fixes to `escapeHTML`, `classify`, `substr`\n* Faster `count`\n* Documentation fixes\n* [Full changelog](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1)\n\n### 2.3.0 ###\n\n* Added `numberformat` method\n* Added `levenshtein` method (Levenshtein distance calculation)\n* Added `swapCase` method\n* Changed default behavior of `words` method\n* Added `toSentenceSerial` method\n* Added `surround` and `quote` methods\n\n### 2.2.1 ###\n\n* Same as 2.2.0 (2.2.0rc on npm) to fix some npm drama\n\n### 2.2.0 ###\n\n* Capitalize method behavior changed\n* Various perfomance tweaks\n\n### 2.1.1###\n\n* Fixed words method bug\n* Added classify method\n\n### 2.1.0 ###\n\n* AMD support\n* Added toSentence method\n* Added slugify method\n* Lots of speed optimizations\n\n### 2.0.0 ###\n\n* Added prune, humanize functions\n* Added _.string (_.str) namespace for Underscore.string library\n* Removed includes function\n\nFor upgrading to this version you need to mix in Underscore.string library to Underscore object:\n\n```javascript\n_.mixin(_.string.exports());\n```\n\nand all non-conflict Underscore.string functions will be available through Underscore object.\nAlso function `includes` has been removed, you should replace this function by `_.str.include`\nor create alias `_.includes = _.str.include` and all your code will work fine.\n\n### 1.1.6 ###\n\n* Fixed reverse and truncate\n* Added isBlank, stripTags, inlude(alias for includes)\n* Added uglifier compression\n\n### 1.1.5 ###\n\n* Added strRight, strRightBack, strLeft, strLeftBack\n\n### 1.1.4 ###\n\n* Added pad, lpad, rpad, lrpad methods and aliases center, ljust, rjust\n* Integration with Underscore 1.1.6\n\n### 1.1.3 ###\n\n* Added methods: underscored, camelize, dasherize\n* Support newer version of npm\n\n### 1.1.2 ###\n\n* Created functions: lines, chars, words functions\n\n### 1.0.2 ###\n\n* Created integration test suite with underscore.js 1.1.4 (now it\'s absolutely compatible)\n* Removed \'reverse\' function, because this function override underscore.js \'reverse\'\n\n## Contribute ##\n\n* Fork & pull request. Don\'t forget about tests.\n* If you planning add some feature please create issue before.\n\nOtherwise changes will be rejected.\n\n## Contributors list ##\n[Can be found here](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/graphs/contributors).\n\n\n## Licence ##\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Esa-Matti Suuronen esa-matti@suuronen.org\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

50087 silly resolved     readme: '# delayed-stream\n\nBuffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require(\'delayed-stream\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `\'error\'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don\'t react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

It comes with useful methods for Arrays (clone, merge, applyToDefaults), Objects (removeKeys, copy), Asserting and more. \r\n\r\nFor example, to use Hoek to set configuration with default options:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Hoek = require(\'hoek\');\r\n\r\nvar default = {url : "www.github.com", port : "8000", debug : true}\r\n\r\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(default, {port : "3000", admin : true});\r\n\r\n// In this case, config would be { url: \'www.github.com\', port: \'3000\', debug: true, admin: true }\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder each of the sections (such as Array), there are subsections which correspond to Hoek methods. Each subsection will explain how to use the corresponding method. In each js excerpt below, the var Hoek = require(\'hoek\') is omitted for brevity.\r\n\r\n## Object\r\n\r\nHoek provides several helpful methods for objects and arrays.\r\n\r\n### clone(obj)\r\n\r\nThis method is used to clone an object or an array. A *deep copy* is made (duplicates everything, including values that are objects). \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar nestedObj = {\r\n        w: /^something$/ig,\r\n        x: {\r\n            a: [1, 2, 3],\r\n            b: 123456,\r\n            c: new Date()\r\n        },\r\n        y: \'y\',\r\n        z: new Date()\r\n    };\r\n\r\nvar copy = Hoek.clone(nestedObj);\r\n\r\ncopy.x.b = 100;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(copy.y)        // results in \'y\'\r\nconsole.log(nestedObj.x.b) // results in 123456\r\nconsole.log(copy.x.b)      // results in 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n### merge(target, source, isNullOverride, isMergeArrays)\r\nisNullOverride, isMergeArrays default to true\r\n\r\nMerge all the properties of source into target, source wins in conflic, and by default null and undefined from source are applied\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar target = {a: 1, b : 2}\r\nvar source = {a: 0, c: 5}\r\nvar source2 = {a: null, c: 5}\r\n\r\nvar targetArray = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar sourceArray = [4, 5];\r\n\r\nvar newTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source);     // results in {a: 0, b: 2, c: 5}\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2);        // results in {a: null, b: 2, c: 5}\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2, false); // results in {a: 1, b: 2, c: 5}\r\n\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray)              // results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray, true, false) // results in [4, 5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### applyToDefaults(defaults, options)\r\n\r\nApply options to a copy of the defaults\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar defaults = {host: "localhost", port: 8000};\r\nvar options = {port: 8080};\r\n\r\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(defaults, options); // results in {host: "localhost", port: 8080};\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### unique(array, key)\r\n\r\nRemove duplicate items from Array\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6];\r\n\r\nvar newArray = Hoek.unique(array); // results in [1,2,3,4,5,6];\r\n\r\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 1}, {id: 2}];\r\n\r\nnewArray = Hoek.unique(array, "id") // results in [{id: 1}, {id: 2}]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### mapToObject(array, key)\r\n\r\nConvert an Array into an Object\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1,2,3];\r\nvar newObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array); // results in [{"1": true}, {"2": true}, {"3": true}]\r\n\r\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 2}];\r\nnewObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array, "id") // results in [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]\r\n\r\n```\r\n### intersect(array1, array2)\r\n\r\nFind the common unique items in two arrays\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array1 = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar array2 = [1, 4, 5];\r\n\r\nvar newArray = Hoek.intersect(array1, array2) // results in [1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### matchKeys(obj, keys) \r\n\r\nFind which keys are present\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};\r\nvar keys = ["a", "e"];\r\n\r\nHoek.matchKeys(obj, keys) // returns ["a"]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### flatten(array, target)\r\n\r\nFlatten an array\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar target = [4, 5]; \r\n\r\nvar flattenedArray = Hoek.flatten(array, target) // results in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### removeKeys(object, keys)\r\n\r\nRemove keys\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};\r\n\r\nvar keys = ["a", "b"];\r\n\r\nHoek.removeKeys(object, keys) // object is now {c: 3, d: 4}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### reach(obj, chain)\r\n\r\nConverts an object key chain string to reference\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar chain = \'a.b.c\';\r\nvar obj = {a : {b : { c : 1}}};\r\n\r\nHoek.reach(obj, chain) // returns 1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### inheritAsync(self, obj, keys) \r\n\r\nInherits a selected set of methods from an object, wrapping functions in asynchronous syntax and catching errors\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar targetFunc = function () { };\r\n\r\nvar proto = {\r\n                a: function () {\r\n                    return \'a!\';\r\n                },\r\n                b: function () {\r\n                    return \'b!\';\r\n                },\r\n                c: function () {\r\n                    throw new Error(\'c!\');\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n\r\nvar keys = [\'a\', \'c\'];\r\n\r\nHoek.inheritAsync(targetFunc, proto, [\'a\', \'c\']);\r\n\r\nvar target = new targetFunc();\r\n\r\ntarget.a(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns \'a!\'       \r\n\r\ntarget.c(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns undefined\r\n\r\ntarget.b(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // gives error: Object [object Object] has no method \'b\'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### rename(obj, from, to)\r\n\r\nRename a key of an object\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar obj = {a : 1, b : 2};\r\n\r\nHoek.rename(obj, "a", "c");     // obj is now {c : 1, b : 2}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timer\r\n\r\nA Timer object. Initializing a new timer object sets the ts to the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n\r\nexample : \r\n\r\n\r\nvar timerObj = new Hoek.Timer();\r\nconsole.log("Time is now: " + timerObj.ts)\r\nconsole.log("Elapsed time from initialization: " + timerObj.elapsed() + \'milliseconds\')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Binary Encoding/Decoding\r\n\r\n### base64urlEncode(value)\r\n\r\nEncodes value in Base64 or URL encoding\r\n\r\n### base64urlDecode(value)\r\n\r\nDecodes data in Base64 or URL encoding.\r\n# Escaping Characters\r\n\r\nHoek provides convenient methods for escaping html characters. The escaped characters are as followed:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\ninternals.htmlEscaped = {\r\n    \'&\': \'&amp;\',\r\n    \'<\': \'&lt;\',\r\n    \'>\': \'&gt;\',\r\n    \'"\': \'&quot;\',\r\n    "\'": \'&#x27;\',\r\n    \'`\': \'&#x60;\'\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### escapeHtml(string)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar string = \'<html> hey </html>\';\r\nvar escapedString = Hoek.escapeHtml(string); // returns &lt;html&gt; hey &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### escapeHeaderAttribute(attribute)\r\n\r\nEscape attribute value for use in HTTP header\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = Hoek.escapeHeaderAttribute(\'I said "go w\\\\o me"\');  //returns I said \\"go w\\\\o me\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### escapeRegex(string)\r\n\r\nEscape string for Regex construction\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = Hoek.escapeRegex(\'4^f$s.4*5+-_?%=#!:@|~\\\\/`"(>)[<]d{}s,\');  // returns 4\\^f\\$s\\.4\\*5\\+\\-_\\?%\\=#\\!\\:@\\|~\\\\\\/`"\\(>\\)\\[<\\]d\\{\\}s\\,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Errors\r\n\r\n### assert(message)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = 1, b =2;\r\n\r\nHoek.assert(a === b, \'a should equal b\');  // ABORT: a should equal b\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### abort(message)\r\n\r\nFirst checks if process.env.NODE_ENV === \'test\', and if so, throws error message. Otherwise,\r\ndisplays most recent stack and then exits process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### displayStack(slice)\r\n\r\nDisplays the trace stack\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar stack = Hoek.displayStack();\r\nconsole.log(stack) // returns something like:\r\n\r\n[ \'null (/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js:4:18)\',\r\n  \'Module._compile (module.js:449:26)\',\r\n  \'Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)\',\r\n  \'Module.load (module.js:356:32)\',\r\n  \'Module._load (module.js:312:12)\',\r\n  \'Module.runMain (module.js:492:10)\',\r\n  \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)\' ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### callStack(slice)\r\n\r\nReturns a trace stack array.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar stack = Hoek.callStack();\r\nconsole.log(stack)  // returns something like:\r\n\r\n[ [ \'/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js\', 4, 18, null, false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 449, 26, \'Module._compile\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 467, 10, \'Module._extensions..js\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 356, 32, \'Module.load\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 312, 12, \'Module._load\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 492, 10, \'Module.runMain\', false ],\r\n  [ \'node.js\',\r\n    244,\r\n    9,\r\n    \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback\',\r\n    false ] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### toss(condition)\r\n\r\ntoss(condition /*, [message], callback */)\r\n\r\nReturn an error as first argument of a callback\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load Files\r\n\r\n### loadPackage(dir)\r\n\r\nLoad and parse package.json process root or given directory\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar pack = Hoek.loadPackage();  // pack.name === \'hoek\'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### loadDirModules(path, excludeFiles, target) \r\n\r\nLoads modules from a given path; option to exclude files (array).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

50241 silly resolved     readme: '# sntp\n\nAn SNTP v4 client (RFC4330) for node. Simpy connects to the NTP or SNTP server requested and returns the server time\nalong with the roundtrip duration and clock offset. To adjust the local time to the NTP time, add the returned `t` offset\nto the local time.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp)\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Sntp = require(\'sntp\');\n\n// All options are optional\n\nvar options = {\n    host: \'nist1-sj.ustiming.org\',  // Defaults to pool.ntp.org\n    port: 123,                      // Defaults to 123 (NTP)\n    resolveReference: true,         // Default to false (not resolving)\n    timeout: 1000                   // Defaults to zero (no timeout)\n};\n\n// Request server time\n\nSntp.time(options, function (err, time) {\n\n    if (err) {\n        console.log(\'Failed: \' + err.message);\n        process.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    console.log(\'Local clock is off by: \' + time.t + \' milliseconds\');\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\nIf an application needs to maintain continuous time synchronization, the module provides a stateful method for\nquerying the current offset only when the last one is too old (defaults to daily).\n\n```javascript\n// Request offset once\n\nSntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n    console.log(offset);                    // New (served fresh)\n\n    // Request offset again\n\n    Sntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n        console.log(offset);                // Identical (served from cache)\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTo set a background offset refresh, start the interval and use the provided now() method. If for any reason the\nclient fails to obtain an up-to-date offset, the current system clock is used.\n\n```javascript\nvar before = Sntp.now();                    // System time without offset\n\nSntp.start(function () {\n\n    var now = Sntp.now();                   // With offset\n    Sntp.stop();\n});\n```\n\n',

50272 silly resolved     readme: '# mute-stream\n\nBytes go in, but they don\'t come out (when muted).\n\nThis is a basic pass-through stream, but when muted, the bytes are\nsilently dropped, rather than being passed through.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar MuteStream = require(\'mute-stream\')\n\nvar ms = new MuteStream(options)\n\nms.pipe(process.stdout)\nms.write(\'foo\') // writes \'foo\' to stdout\nms.mute()\nms.write(\'bar\') // does not write \'bar\'\nms.unmute()\nms.write(\'baz\') // writes \'baz\' to stdout\n\n// can also be used to mute incoming data\nvar ms = new MuteStream\ninput.pipe(ms)\n\nms.on(\'data\', function (c) {\n  console.log(\'data: \' + c)\n})\n\ninput.emit(\'data\', \'foo\') // logs \'foo\'\nms.mute()\ninput.emit(\'data\', \'bar\') // does not log \'bar\'\nms.unmute()\ninput.emit(\'data\', \'baz\') // logs \'baz\'\n```\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are optional.\n\n* `replace` Set to a string to replace each character with the\n  specified string when muted.  (So you can show `****` instead of the\n  password, for example.)\n\n* `prompt` If you are using a replacement char, and also using a\n  prompt with a readline stream (as for a `Password: *****` input),\n  then specify what the prompt is so that backspace will work\n  properly.  Otherwise, pressing backspace will overwrite the prompt\n  with the replacement character, which is weird.\n\n## ms.mute()\n\nSet `muted` to `true`.  Turns `.write()` into a no-op.\n\n## ms.unmute()\n\nSet `muted` to `false`\n\n## ms.isTTY\n\nTrue if the pipe destination is a TTY, or if the incoming pipe source is\na TTY.\n\n## Other stream methods...\n\nThe other standard readable and writable stream methods are all\navailable.  The MuteStream object acts as a facade to its pipe source\nand destination.\n',

51251 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

More specifically, this module is for people who like all the --bells\nand -whistlz of program usage but think optstrings are a waste of time.\n\nWith optimist, option parsing doesn\'t have to suck (as much).\n\nexamples\n========\n\nWith Optimist, the options are just a hash! No optstrings attached.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nxup.js:\n\n````javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nvar argv = require(\'optimist\').argv;\n\nif (argv.rif - 5 * argv.xup > 7.138) {\n    console.log(\'Buy more riffiwobbles\');\n}\nelse {\n    console.log(\'Sell the xupptumblers\');\n}\n````\n\n***\n\n    $ ./xup.js --rif=55 --xup=9.52\n    Buy more riffiwobbles\n    \n    $ ./xup.js --rif 12 --xup 8.1\n    Sell the xupptumblers\n\n![This one\'s optimistic.](http://substack.net/images/optimistic.png)\n\nBut wait! There\'s more! You can do short options:\n-------------------------------------------------\n \nshort.js:\n\n````javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nvar argv = require(\'optimist\').argv;\nconsole.log(\'(%d,%d)\', argv.x, argv.y);\n````\n\n***\n\n    $ ./short.js -x 10 -y 21\n    (10,21)\n\nAnd booleans, both long and short (and grouped):\n----------------------------------\n\nbool.js:\n\n````javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nvar util = require(\'util\');\nvar argv = require(\'optimist\').argv;\n\nif (argv.s) {\n    util.print(argv.fr ? \'Le chat dit: \' : \'The cat says: \');\n}\nconsole.log(\n    (argv.fr ? \'miaou\' : \'meow\') + (argv.p ? \'.\' : \'\')\n);\n````\n\n***\n\n    $ ./bool.js -s\n    The cat says: meow\n    \n    $ ./bool.js -sp\n    The cat says: meow.\n\n    $ ./bool.js -sp --fr\n    Le chat dit: miaou.\n\nAnd non-hypenated options too!

Inside `message`, the string\n`$0` will get interpolated to the current script name or node command for the\npresent script similar to how `$0` works in bash or perl.\n\n.check(fn)\n----------\n\nCheck that certain conditions are met in the provided arguments.\n\nIf `fn` throws or returns `false`, show the thrown error, usage information, and\nexit.\n\n.boolean(key)\n-------------\n\nInterpret `key` as a boolean. If a non-flag option follows `key` in\n`process.argv`, that string won\'t get set as the value of `key`.\n\nIf `key` never shows up as a flag in `process.arguments`, `argv[key]` will be\n`false`.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as booleans.\n\n.string(key)\n------------\n\nTell the parser logic not to interpret `key` as a number or boolean.\nThis can be useful if you need to preserve leading zeros in an input.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as strings.\n\n.wrap(columns)\n--------------\n\nFormat usage output to wrap at `columns` many columns.\n\n.help()\n-------\n\nReturn the generated usage string.\n\n.showHelp(fn=console.error)\n---------------------------\n\nPrint the usage data using `fn` for printing.\n\n.parse(args)\n------------\n\nParse `args` instead of `process.argv`. Returns the `argv` object.\n\n.argv\n-----\n\nGet the arguments as a plain old object.\n\nArguments without a corresponding flag show up in the `argv._` array.\n\nThe script name or node command is available at `argv.$0` similarly to how `$0`\nworks in bash or perl.\n\nparsing tricks\n==============\n\nstop parsing\n------------\n\nUse `--` to stop parsing flags and stuff the remainder into `argv._`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a 1 -b 2 -- -c 3 -d 4\n    { _: [ \'-c\', \'3\', \'-d\', \'4\' ],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: 1,\n      b: 2 }\n\nnegate fields\n-------------\n\nIf you want to explicity set a field to false instead of just leaving it\nundefined or to override a default you can do `--no-key`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a --no-b\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: true,\n      b: false }\n\nnumbers\n-------\n\nEvery argument that looks like a number (`!isNaN(Number(arg))`) is converted to\none. This way you can just `net.createConnection(argv.port)` and you can add\nnumbers out of `argv` with `+` without having that mean concatenation,\nwhich is super frustrating.\n\nduplicates\n----------\n\nIf you specify a flag multiple times it will get turned into an array containing\nall the values in order.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -x 5 -x 8 -x 0\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n        x: [ 5, 8, 0 ] }\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nWith [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), just do:\n    npm install optimist\n \nor clone this project on github:\n\n    git clone http://github.com/substack/node-optimist.git\n\nTo run the tests with [expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso),\njust do:\n    \n    expresso\n\ninspired By\n===========\n\nThis module is loosely inspired by Perl\'s\n[Getopt::Casual](http://search.cpan.org/~photo/Getopt-Casual-0.13.1/Casual.pm).\n',

It comes with useful methods for Ararys (clone, merge, applyToDefaults), Objects (removeKeys, copy), Asserting and more. \n\nFor example, to use Hoek to set configuration with default options:\n```javascript\nvar Hoek = require(\'hoek\');\n\nvar default = {url : "www.github.com", port : "8000", debug : true}\n\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(default, {port : "3000", admin : true});\n\n// In this case, config would be { url: \'www.github.com\', port: \'3000\', debug: true, admin: true }\n```\n\nUnder each of the sections (such as Array), there are subsections which correspond to Hoek methods. Each subsection will explain how to use the corresponding method. In each js excerpt below, the var Hoek = require(\'hoek\') is omitted for brevity.\n\n## Object\n\nHoek provides several helpful methods for objects and arrays.\n\n### clone(obj)\n\nThis method is used to clone an object or an array. A *deep copy* is made (duplicates everything, including values that are objects). \n\n```javascript\n\nvar nestedObj = {\n        w: /^something$/ig,\n        x: {\n            a: [1, 2, 3],\n            b: 123456,\n            c: new Date()\n        },\n        y: \'y\',\n        z: new Date()\n    };\n\nvar copy = Hoek.clone(nestedObj);\n\ncopy.x.b = 100;\n\nconsole.log(copy.y)        // results in \'y\'\nconsole.log(nestedObj.x.b) // results in 123456\nconsole.log(copy.x.b)      // results in 100\n```\n\n### merge(target, source, isNullOverride, isMergeArrays)\nisNullOverride, isMergeArrays default to true\n\nMerge all the properties of source into target, source wins in conflic, and by default null and undefined from source are applied\n\n\n```javascript\n\nvar target = {a: 1, b : 2}\nvar source = {a: 0, c: 5}\nvar source2 = {a: null, c: 5}\n\nvar targetArray = [1, 2, 3];\nvar sourceArray = [4, 5];\n\nvar newTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source);     // results in {a: 0, b: 2, c: 5}\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2);        // results in {a: null, b: 2, c: 5}\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2, false); // results in {a: null, b:2, c: 5}\n\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray)              // results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray, true, false) // results in [4, 5]\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n### applyToDefaults(defaults, options)\n\nApply options to a copy of the defaults\n\n```javascript\n\nvar defaults = {host: "localhost", port: 8000};\nvar options = {port: 8080};\n\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(defaults, options); // results in {host: "localhost", port: 8080};\n\n\n```\n\n### unique(array, key)\n\nRemove duplicate items from Array\n\n```javascript\n\nvar array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n\nvar newArray = Hoek.unique(array); // results in [1,2,3,4,5,6];\n\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 1}, {id: 2}];\n\nnewArray = Hoek.unique(array, "id") // results in [{id: 1}, {id: 2}]\n\n```\n\n### mapToObject(array, key)\n\nConvert an Array into an Object\n\n```javascript\n\nvar array = [1,2,3];\nvar newObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array); // results in [{"1": true}, {"2": true}, {"3": true}]\n\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 2}];\nnewObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array, "id") // results in [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]\n\n```\n### intersect(array1, array2)\n\nFind the common unique items in two arrays\n\n```javascript\n\nvar array1 = [1, 2, 3];\nvar array2 = [1, 4, 5];\n\nvar newArray = Hoek.intersect(array1, array2) // results in [1]\n\n```\n\n### matchKeys(obj, keys) \n\nFind which keys are present\n\n```javascript\n\nvar obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};\nvar keys = ["a", "e"];\n\nHoek.matchKeys(obj, keys) // returns ["a"]\n\n```\n\n### flatten(array, target)\n\nFlatten an array\n\n```javascript\n\nvar array = [1, 2, 3];\nvar target = [4, 5]; \n\nvar flattenedArray = Hoek.flatten(array, target) // results in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3];\n\n```\n\n### removeKeys(object, keys)\n\nRemove keys\n\n```javascript\n\nvar object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};\n\nvar keys = ["a", "b"];\n\nHoek.removeKeys(object, keys) // object is now {c: 3, d: 4}\n\n```\n\n### reach(obj, chain)\n\nConverts an object key chain string to reference\n\n```javascript\n\nvar chain = \'a.b.c\';\nvar obj = {a : {b : { c : 1}}};\n\nHoek.reach(obj, chain) // returns 1\n\n```\n\n### inheritAsync(self, obj, keys) \n\nInherits a selected set of methods from an object, wrapping functions in asynchronous syntax and catching errors\n\n```javascript\n\nvar targetFunc = function () { };\n\nvar proto = {\n                a: function () {\n                    return \'a!\';\n                },\n                b: function () {\n                    return \'b!\';\n                },\n                c: function () {\n                    throw new Error(\'c!\');\n                }\n            };\n\nvar keys = [\'a\', \'c\'];\n\nHoek.inheritAsync(targetFunc, proto, [\'a\', \'c\']);\n\nvar target = new targetFunc();\n\ntarget.a(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns \'a!\'       \n\ntarget.c(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns undefined\n\ntarget.b(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // gives error: Object [object Object] has no method \'b\'\n\n```\n\n### rename(obj, from, to)\n\nRename a key of an object\n\n```javascript\n\nvar obj = {a : 1, b : 2};\n\nHoek.rename(obj, "a", "c");     // obj is now {c : 1, b : 2}\n\n```\n\n\n# Timer\n\nA Timer object. Initializing a new timer object sets the ts to the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC.\n\n```javascript\n\n\nexample : \n\n\nvar timerObj = new Hoek.Timer();\nconsole.log("Time is now: " + timerObj.ts)\nconsole.log("Elapsed time from initialization: " + timerObj.elapsed() + \'milliseconds\')\n\n```\n\n# Binary Encoding/Decoding\n\n### base64urlEncode(value)\n\nEncodes value in Base64 or URL encoding\n\n### base64urlDecode(value)\n\nDecodes data in Base64 or URL encoding.\n# Escaping Characters\n\nHoek provides convenient methods for escaping html characters. The escaped characters are as followed:\n\n```javascript\n\ninternals.htmlEscaped = {\n    \'&\': \'&amp;\',\n    \'<\': \'&lt;\',\n    \'>\': \'&gt;\',\n    \'"\': \'&quot;\',\n    "\'": \'&#x27;\',\n    \'`\': \'&#x60;\'\n};\n\n```\n\n### escapeHtml(string)\n\n```javascript\n\nvar string = \'<html> hey </html>\';\nvar escapedString = Hoek.escapeHtml(string); // returns &lt;html&gt; hey &lt;/html&gt;\n\n```\n\n### escapeHeaderAttribute(attribute)\n\nEscape attribute value for use in HTTP header\n\n```javascript\n\nvar a = Hoek.escapeHeaderAttribute(\'I said "go w\\\\o me"\');  //returns I said \\"go w\\\\o me\\"\n\n\n```\n\n\n### escapeRegex(string)\n\nEscape string for Regex construction\n\n```javascript\n\nvar a = Hoek.escapeRegex(\'4^f$s.4*5+-_?%=#!:@|~\\\\/`"(>)[<]d{}s,\');  // returns 4\\^f\\$s\\.4\\*5\\+\\-_\\?%\\=#\\!\\:@\\|~\\\\\\/`"\\(>\\)\\[<\\]d\\{\\}s\\,\n\n\n\n```\n\n# Errors\n\n### assert(message)\n\n```javascript\n\nvar a = 1, b =2;\n\nHoek.assert(a === b, \'a should equal b\');  // ABORT: a should equal b\n\n```\n\n### abort(message)\n\nFirst checks if process.env.NODE_ENV === \'test\', and if so, throws error message. Otherwise,\ndisplays most recent stack and then exits process.\n\n\n\n### displayStack(slice)\n\nDisplays the trace stack\n\n```javascript\n\nvar stack = Hoek.displayStack();\nconsole.log(stack) // returns something like:\n\n[ \'null (/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js:4:18)\',\n  \'Module._compile (module.js:449:26)\',\n  \'Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)\',\n  \'Module.load (module.js:356:32)\',\n  \'Module._load (module.js:312:12)\',\n  \'Module.runMain (module.js:492:10)\',\n  \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)\' ]\n\n```\n\n### callStack(slice)\n\nReturns a trace stack array.\n\n```javascript\n\nvar stack = Hoek.callStack();\nconsole.log(stack)  // returns something like:\n\n[ [ \'/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js\', 4, 18, null, false ],\n  [ \'module.js\', 449, 26, \'Module._compile\', false ],\n  [ \'module.js\', 467, 10, \'Module._extensions..js\', false ],\n  [ \'module.js\', 356, 32, \'Module.load\', false ],\n  [ \'module.js\', 312, 12, \'Module._load\', false ],\n  [ \'module.js\', 492, 10, \'Module.runMain\', false ],\n  [ \'node.js\',\n    244,\n    9,\n    \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback\',\n    false ] ]\n\n\n```\n\n### toss(condition)\n\ntoss(condition /*, [message], callback */)\n\nReturn an error as first argument of a callback\n\n\n# Load Files\n\n### loadPackage(dir)\n\nLoad and parse package.json process root or given directory\n\n```javascript\n\nvar pack = Hoek.loadPackage();  // pack.name === \'hoek\'\n\n```\n\n### loadDirModules(path, excludeFiles, target) \n\nLoads modules from a given path; option to exclude files (array).\n\n\n\n\n',

51510 silly resolved     readme: '# sntp\n\nAn SNTP v4 client (RFC4330) for node. Simpy connects to the NTP or SNTP server requested and returns the server time\nalong with the roundtrip duration and clock offset. To adjust the local time to the NTP time, add the returned `t` offset\nto the local time.\n\nCurrent version: **0.1.1**\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp)\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Sntp = require(\'sntp\');\n\n// All options are optional\n\nvar options = {\n    host: \'nist1-sj.ustiming.org\',  // Defaults to pool.ntp.org\n    port: 123,                      // Defaults to 123 (NTP)\n    resolveReference: true,         // Default to false (not resolving)\n    timeout: 1000                   // Defaults to zero (no timeout)\n};\n\n// Request server time\n\nSntp.time(options, function (err, time) {\n\n    if (err) {\n        console.log(\'Failed: \' + err.message);\n        process.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    console.log(\'Local clock is off by: \' + time.t + \' milliseconds\');\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\nIf an application needs to maintain continuous time synchronization, the module provides a stateful method for\nquerying the current offset only when the last one is too old (defaults to daily).\n\n```javascript\n// Request offset once\n\nSntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n    console.log(offset);                    // New (served fresh)\n\n    // Request offset again\n\n    Sntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n        console.log(offset);                // Identical (served from cache)\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTo set a background offset refresh, start the interval and use the provided now() method. If for any reason the\nclient fails to obtain an up-to-date offset, the current system clock is used.\n\n```javascript\nvar before = Sntp.now();                    // System time without offset\n\nSntp.start(function () {\n\n    var now = Sntp.now();                   // With offset\n    Sntp.stop();\n});\n```\n\n',

51621 silly resolved     readme: '# EventEmitter2\n\nEventEmitter2 is a an implementation of the EventEmitter found in Node.js\n\n## Features\n\n - Namespaces/Wildcards.\n - Times To Listen (TTL), extends the `once` concept with `many`.\n - Browser environment compatibility.\n - Demonstrates good performance in benchmarks\n\n```\nEventEmitterHeatUp x 3,728,965 ops/sec \\302\\2610.68% (60 runs sampled)\nEventEmitter x 2,822,904 ops/sec \\302\\2610.74% (63 runs sampled)\nEventEmitter2 x 7,251,227 ops/sec \\302\\2610.55% (58 runs sampled)\nEventEmitter2 (wild) x 3,220,268 ops/sec \\302\\2610.44% (65 runs sampled)\nFastest is EventEmitter2\n```\n\n## Differences (Non breaking, compatible with existing EventEmitter)\n\n - The constructor takes a configuration object.\n \n```javascript\n    var EventEmitter2 = require(\'eventemitter2\').EventEmitter2;\n    var server = new EventEmitter2({\n      wildcard: true, // should the event emitter use wildcards.\n      delimiter: \'::\', // the delimiter used to segment namespaces, defaults to `.`.\n      newListener: false, // if you want to emit the newListener event set to true.\n      maxListeners: 20, // the max number of listeners that can be assigned to an event, defaults to 10.\n    });\n```\n\n - Getting the actual event that fired.\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'foo.*\', function(value1, value2) {\n      console.log(this.event, value1, value2);\n    });\n```\n\n - Fire an event N times and then remove it, an extension of the `once` concept.\n\n```javascript\n    server.many(\'foo\', 4, function() {\n      console.log(\'hello\');\n    });\n```\n\n - Pass in a namespaced event as an array rather than a delimited string.\n\n```javascript\n    server.many([\'foo\', \'bar\', \'bazz\'], function() {\n      console.log(\'hello\');\n    });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\nWhen an `EventEmitter` instance experiences an error, the typical action is\nto emit an `error` event. Error events are treated as a special case.\nIf there is no listener for it, then the default action is to print a stack\ntrace and exit the program.\n\nAll EventEmitters emit the event `newListener` when new listeners are\nadded.\n\n\n**Namespaces** with **Wildcards**\nTo use namespaces/wildcards, pass the `wildcard` option into the EventEmitter constructor.\nWhen namespaces/wildcards are enabled, events can either be strings (`foo.bar`) separated\nby a delimiter or arrays (`[\'foo\', \'bar\']`). The delimiter is also configurable as a \nconstructor option.\n\nAn event name passed to any event emitter method can contain a wild card (the `*` character).\nIf the event name is a string, a wildcard may appear as `foo.*`. If the event name is an array, \nthe wildcard may appear as `[\'foo\', \'*\']`.\n\nIf either of the above described events were passed to the `on` method, subsequent emits such \nas the following would be observed...\n\n```javascript\n   emitter.emit(\'foo.bazz\');\n   emitter.emit([\'foo\', \'bar\']);\n```\n\n\n#### emitter.addListener(event, listener)\n#### emitter.on(event, listener)\n\nAdds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'data\', function(value1, value2, value3 /* accepts any number of expected values... */) {\n      console.log(\'The event was raised!\');\n    });\n```\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'data\', function(value) {\n      console.log(\'The event was raised!\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.onAny(listener)\n\nAdds a listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.\n\n```javascript\n    server.onAny(function(value) {\n      console.log(\'All events trigger this.\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.offAny(listener)\n\nRemoves the listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.\n\n```javascript\n    server.offAny(function(value) {\n      console.log(\'The event was raised!\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.once(event, listener)\n\nAdds a **one time** listener for the event. The listener is invoked only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.\n\n```javascript\n    server.once(\'get\', function (value) {\n      console.log(\'Ah, we have our first value!\');\n    });\n```\n\n#### emitter.many(event, timesToListen, listener)\n\nAdds a listener that will execute **n times** for the event before being removed. The listener is invoked only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.\n\n```javascript\n    server.many(\'get\', 4, function (value) {\n      console.log(\'This event will be listened to exactly four times.\');\n    });\n```\n\n\n#### emitter.removeListener(event, listener)\n#### emitter.off(event, listener)\n\nRemove a listener from the listener array for the specified event. **Caution**: changes array indices in the listener array behind the listener.\n\n```javascript\n    var callback = function(value) {\n      console.log(\'someone connected!\');\n    };\n    server.on(\'get\', callback);\n    // ...\n    server.removeListener(\'get\', callback);\n```\n\n\n#### emitter.removeAllListeners([event])\n\nRemoves all listeners, or those of the specified event.\n\n\n#### emitter.setMaxListeners(n)\n\nBy default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added to it. This is a useful default which helps finding memory leaks. Obviously not all Emitters should be limited to 10. This function allows that to be increased. Set to zero for unlimited.\n\n\n#### emitter.listeners(event)\n\nReturns an array of listeners for the specified event. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.\n\n```javascript\n    server.on(\'get\', function(value) {\n      console.log(\'someone connected!\');\n    });\n    console.log(console.log(server.listeners(\'get\')); // [ [Function] ]\n```\n\n#### emitter.listenersAny()\n\nReturns an array of listeners that are listening for any event that is specified. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.\n\n```javascript\n    server.onAny(function(value) {\n      console.log(\'someone connected!\');\n    });\n    console.log(console.log(server.listenersAny()[0]); // [ [Function] ] // someone connected!\n```\n\n#### emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...])\n\nExecute each of the listeners that may be listening for the specified event name in order with the list of arguments.\n\n## Test coverage\n\nThere is a test suite that tries to cover each use case, it can be found <a href="https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2/tree/master/test">here</a>.\n\n## Licence\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 hij1nx <http://www.twitter.com/hij1nx>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

51621 silly resolved     readme: '# utile [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/flatiron/utile.png)](http://travis-ci.org/flatiron/utile)\n\nA drop-in replacement for `util` with some additional advantageous functions\n\n## Motivation\nJavascript is definitely a "batteries not included language" when compared to languages like Ruby or Python. Node.js has a simple utility library which exposes some basic (but important) functionality:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var util = require(\'util\');\n> util.\n(...)\n\nutil.debug                 util.error                 util.exec                  util.inherits              util.inspect\nutil.log                   util.p                     util.print                 util.pump                  util.puts\n```\n\nWhen one considers their own utility library, why ever bother requiring `util` again? That is the approach taken by this module. To compare:\n\n```\n$ node\n> var utile = require(\'./lib\')\n> utile.\n(...)\n\nutile.async                 utile.capitalize            utile.clone                 utile.cpr                   utile.createPath            utile.debug\nutile.each                  utile.error                 utile.exec                  utile.file                  utile.filter                utile.find\nutile.inherits              utile.log                   utile.mixin                 utile.mkdirp                utile.p                     utile.path\nutile.print                 utile.pump                  utile.puts                  utile.randomString          utile.requireDir            uile.requireDirLazy\nutile.rimraf\n```\n\nAs you can see all of the original methods from `util` are there, but there are several new methods specific to `utile`. A note about implementation: _no node.js native modules are modified by utile, it simply copies those methods._\n\n## Methods\nThe `utile` modules exposes some simple utility methods:\n\n* `.each(obj, iterator)`: Iterate over the keys of an object.\n* `.mixin(target [source0, source1, ...])`: Copies enumerable properties from `source0 ... sourceN` onto `target` and returns the resulting object.\n* `.clone(obj)`: Shallow clones the specified object.\n* `.capitalize(str)`: Capitalizes the specified `str`.\n* `.randomString(length)`: randomString returns a pseudo-random ASCII string (subset) the return value is a string of length ⌈bits/6⌉ of characters from the base64 alphabet.\n* `.filter(obj, test)`: return an object with the properties that `test` returns true on.\n* `.args(arguments)`: Converts function arguments into actual array with special `callback`, `cb`, `array`, and `last` properties. Also supports *optional* argument contracts. See [the example](https://github.com/flatiron/utile/blob/master/examples/utile-args.js) for more details.\n* `.requireDir(directory)`: Requires all files and directories from `directory`, returning an object with keys being filenames (without trailing `.js`) and respective values being return values of `require(filename)`.\n* `.requireDirLazy(directory)`: Lazily requires all files and directories from `directory`, returning an object with keys being filenames (without trailing `.js`) and respective values (getters) being return values of `require(filename)`.\n* `.format([string] text, [array] formats, [array] replacements)`: Replace `formats` in `text` with `replacements`. This will fall back to the original `util.format` command if it is called improperly.\n\n## Packaged Dependencies\nIn addition to the methods that are built-in, utile includes a number of commonly used dependencies to reduce the number of includes in your package.json. These modules _are not eagerly loaded to be respectful of startup time,_ but instead are lazy-loaded getters on the `utile` object\n\n* `.async`: [Async utilities for node and the browser][0]\n* `.inflect`: [Customizable inflections for node.js][6]\n* `.mkdirp`: [Recursively mkdir, like mkdir -p, but in node.js][1]\n* `.rimraf`: [A rm -rf util for nodejs][2]\n* `.cpr`: [Asynchronous recursive file copying with Node.js][3]\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing npm (node package manager)\n```\n  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### Installing utile\n```\n  [sudo] npm install utile\n```\n\n## Tests\nAll tests are written with [vows][4] and should be run with [npm][5]:\n\n``` bash\n  $ npm test\n```\n\n#### Author: [Nodejitsu Inc.](http://www.nodejitsu.com)\n#### Contributors: [Charlie Robbins](http://github.com/indexzero), [Dominic Tarr](http://github.com/dominictarr)\n#### License: MIT\n\n[0]: https://github.com/caolan/async\n[1]: https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp\n[2]: https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf\n[3]: https://github.com/avianflu/ncp\n[4]: https://vowsjs.org\n[5]: https://npmjs.org\n[6]: https://github.com/pksunkara/inflect\n',

52147 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

Inside `message`, the string\n`$0` will get interpolated to the current script name or node command for the\npresent script similar to how `$0` works in bash or perl.\n\n.check(fn)\n----------\n\nCheck that certain conditions are met in the provided arguments.\n\nIf `fn` throws or returns `false`, show the thrown error, usage information, and\nexit.\n\n.boolean(key)\n-------------\n\nInterpret `key` as a boolean. If a non-flag option follows `key` in\n`process.argv`, that string won\'t get set as the value of `key`.\n\nIf `key` never shows up as a flag in `process.arguments`, `argv[key]` will be\n`false`.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as booleans.\n\n.string(key)\n------------\n\nTell the parser logic not to interpret `key` as a number or boolean.\nThis can be useful if you need to preserve leading zeros in an input.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as strings.\n\n.wrap(columns)\n--------------\n\nFormat usage output to wrap at `columns` many columns.\n\n.help()\n-------\n\nReturn the generated usage string.\n\n.showHelp(fn=console.error)\n---------------------------\n\nPrint the usage data using `fn` for printing.\n\n.parse(args)\n------------\n\nParse `args` instead of `process.argv`. Returns the `argv` object.\n\n.argv\n-----\n\nGet the arguments as a plain old object.\n\nArguments without a corresponding flag show up in the `argv._` array.\n\nThe script name or node command is available at `argv.$0` similarly to how `$0`\nworks in bash or perl.\n\nparsing tricks\n==============\n\nstop parsing\n------------\n\nUse `--` to stop parsing flags and stuff the remainder into `argv._`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a 1 -b 2 -- -c 3 -d 4\n    { _: [ \'-c\', \'3\', \'-d\', \'4\' ],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: 1,\n      b: 2 }\n\nnegate fields\n-------------\n\nIf you want to explicity set a field to false instead of just leaving it\nundefined or to override a default you can do `--no-key`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a --no-b\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: true,\n      b: false }\n\nnumbers\n-------\n\nEvery argument that looks like a number (`!isNaN(Number(arg))`) is converted to\none. This way you can just `net.createConnection(argv.port)` and you can add\nnumbers out of `argv` with `+` without having that mean concatenation,\nwhich is super frustrating.\n\nduplicates\n----------\n\nIf you specify a flag multiple times it will get turned into an array containing\nall the values in order.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -x 5 -x 8 -x 0\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n        x: [ 5, 8, 0 ] }\n\ndot notation\n------------\n\nWhen you use dots (`.`s) in argument names, an implicit object path is assumed.\nThis lets you organize arguments into nested objects.\n\n     $ node examples/reflect.js --foo.bar.baz=33 --foo.quux=5\n     { _: [],\n       \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n         foo: { bar: { baz: 33 }, quux: 5 } }\n\nshort numbers\n-------------\n\nShort numeric `head -n5` style argument work too:\n\n    $ node reflect.js -n123 -m456\n    { \'3\': true,\n      \'6\': true,\n      _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./reflect.js\',\n      n: 123,\n      m: 456 }\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nWith [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), just do:\n    npm install optimist\n \nor clone this project on github:\n\n    git clone http://github.com/substack/node-optimist.git\n\nTo run the tests with [expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso),\njust do:\n    \n    expresso\n\ninspired By\n===========\n\nThis module is loosely inspired by Perl\'s\n[Getopt::Casual](http://search.cpan.org/~photo/Getopt-Casual-0.13.1/Casual.pm).\n',

See Tags on GitHub.\n\nOr in a Node.js application via the package manager:\n\n    npm install escodegen\n\n### Usage\n\nA simple example: the program\n\n    escodegen.generate({\n        type: \'BinaryExpression\',\n        operator: \'+\',\n        left: { type: \'Literal\', value: 40 },\n        right: { type: \'Literal\', value: 2 }\n    });\n\nproduces the string `\'40 + 2\'`\n\nSee the [API page](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen/wiki/API) for\noptions. To run the tests, execute `npm test` in the root directory.\n\n### Building browser bundle / minified browser bundle\n\nAt first, executing `npm install` to install the all dev dependencies.\nAfter that,\n\n    npm run-script build\n\nwill generate `escodegen.browser.js`, it is used on the browser environment.\n\nAnd,\n\n    npm run-script build-min\n\nwill generate minified `escodegen.browser.min.js`.\n\n### License\n\n#### Escodegen\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 [Yusuke Suzuki](http://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](http://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

When returning node from `enter`/`leave`, current node is replaced with it.\n\n```javascript\nresult = estraverse.replace(tree, {\n    enter: function (node) {\n        // Replace it with replaced.\n        if (node.type === \'Literal\')\n            return replaced;\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012-2013 [Yusuke Suzuki](http://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](http://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

52892 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser.\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, forEach…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n    async.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n        // results is now an array of stats for each file\n    });\n\n    async.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n        // results now equals an array of the existing files\n    });\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(){ ... },\n        function(){ ... }\n    ], callback);\n\n    async.series([\n        function(){ ... },\n        function(){ ... }\n    ]);\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n\n## Download\n\nReleases are available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async/downloads).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n    npm install async\n\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 17.5kb Uncompressed\n\n__Production:__ [async.min.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/dist/async.min.js) - 1.7kb Packed and Gzipped\n\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far its been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. Usage:\n\n    <script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n    <script type="text/javascript">\n\n        async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n            alert(results);\n        });\n\n    </script>\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [forEach](#forEach)\n* [map](#map)\n* [filter](#filter)\n* [reject](#reject)\n* [reduce](#reduce)\n* [detect](#detect)\n* [sortBy](#sortBy)\n* [some](#some)\n* [every](#every)\n* [concat](#concat)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [series](#series)\n* [parallel](#parallel)\n* [whilst](#whilst)\n* [until](#until)\n* [waterfall](#waterfall)\n* [queue](#queue)\n* [auto](#auto)\n* [iterator](#iterator)\n* [apply](#apply)\n* [nextTick](#nextTick)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [memoize](#memoize)\n* [unmemoize](#unmemoize)\n* [log](#log)\n* [dir](#dir)\n* [noConflict](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n### forEach(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies an iterator function to each item in an array, in parallel.\nThe iterator is called with an item from the list and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main\ncallback for the forEach function is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n    // to save the modified contents of that file:\n\n    async.forEach(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n### forEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as forEach only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n### forEachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as forEach only the iterator is applied to batches of items in the\narray, in series. The next batch of iterators is only called once the current\none has completed processing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* limit - How many items should be in each batch.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n    // function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\n    async.forEachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n        // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n    });\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in the given array through\nthe iterator function. The iterator is called with an item from the array and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. The callback takes 2 arguments, \nan error and the transformed item from the array. If the iterator passes an\nerror to this callback, the main callback for the map function is immediately\ncalled with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order, however\nthe results array will be in the same order as the original array.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n        // results is now an array of stats for each file\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as map only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ select\n\nReturns a new array of all the values which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n        // results now equals an array of the existing files\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__alias:__ selectSeries\n\nThe same as filter only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of filter. Removes values that pass an async truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as filter, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__aliases:__ inject, foldl\n\nReduces a list of values into a single value using an async iterator to return\neach successive step. Memo is the initial state of the reduction. This\nfunction only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to\nsplit a call to this function into a parallel map, then use the normal\nArray.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where\neach step in the reduction needs to be async, if you can get the data before\nreducing it then its probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* memo - The initial state of the reduction.\n* iterator(memo, item, callback) - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iterator is passed a\n  callback which accepts an optional error as its first argument, and the state\n  of the reduction as the second. If an error is passed to the callback, the\n  reduction is stopped and the main callback is immediately called with the\n  error.\n* callback(err, result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n        // pointless async:\n        process.nextTick(function(){\n            callback(null, memo + item)\n        });\n    }, function(err, result){\n        // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ foldr\n\nSame as reduce, only operates on the items in the array in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in a list that passes an async truth test. The\niterator is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return true will\nfire the detect callback with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original array (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original array is important then look at detectSeries.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value undefined if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as detect, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original array (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each value through an async iterator.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and a value to use as the sort criteria.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is the items from\n  the original array sorted by the values returned by the iterator calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n        fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n            callback(err, stats.mtime);\n        });\n    }, function(err, results){\n        // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n        // modified date\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ any\n\nReturns true if at least one element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. Once any iterator\ncall returns true, the main callback is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either true or false depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ all\n\nReturns true if every element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on\n  the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.every([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n        // if result is true then every file exists\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concat" />\n### concat(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies an iterator to each item in a list, concatenating the results. Returns the\nconcatenated list. The iterators are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of the arguments passed to the iterator function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback which must be called once it has completed\n  with an error (which can be null) and an array of results.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the iterator function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n        // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n    });\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as async.concat, but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run and the callback for the series is\nimmediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed,\nthe results are passed to the final callback as an array.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.series.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a callback it must call on completion.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets an array of all the arguments passed to\n  the callbacks used in the array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            // do some stuff ...\n            callback(null, \'one\');\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // do some more stuff ...\n            callback(null, \'two\');\n        },\n    ],\n    // optional callback\n    function(err, results){\n        // results is now equal to [\'one\', \'two\']\n    });\n\n\n    // an example using an object instead of an array\n    async.series({\n        one: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 1);\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        two: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 2);\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    },\n    function(err, results) {\n        // results is now equal to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallel" />\n### parallel(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous\nfunction has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its\ncallback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error.\nOnce the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an\narray.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.parallel.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed a\n  callback it must call on completion.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets an array of all the arguments passed to\n  the callbacks used in the array.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, \'one\');\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, \'two\');\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    ],\n    // optional callback\n    function(err, results){\n        // the results array will equal [\'one\',\'two\'] even though\n        // the second function had a shorter timeout.\n    });\n\n\n    // an example using an object instead of an array\n    async.parallel({\n        one: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 1);\n            }, 200);\n        },\n        two: function(callback){\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                callback(null, 2);\n            }, 100);\n        },\n    },\n    function(err, results) {\n        // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="whilst" />\n### whilst(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, while test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* test() - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn.\n* fn(callback) - A function to call each time the test passes. The function is\n  passed a callback which must be called once it has completed with an optional\n  error as the first argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated\n  execution of fn has stopped.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var count = 0;\n\n    async.whilst(\n        function () { return count < 5; },\n        function (callback) {\n            count++;\n            setTimeout(callback, 1000);\n        },\n        function (err) {\n            // 5 seconds have passed\n        }\n    );\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="until" />\n### until(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, until test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\nThe inverse of async.whilst.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns an array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the functions pass an error to the callback, the\nnext function is not executed and the main callback is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback it\n  must call on completion.\n* callback(err, [results]) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.waterfall([\n        function(callback){\n            callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n        },\n        function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n            callback(null, \'three\');\n        },\n        function(arg1, callback){\n            // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n            callback(null, \'done\');\n        }\n    ], function (err, result) {\n       // result now equals \'done\'    \n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a queue object with the specified concurrency. Tasks added to the\nqueue will be processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit). If all\nworkers are in progress, the task is queued until one is available. Once\na worker has completed a task, the task\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* worker(task, callback) - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task.\n* concurrency - An integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe queue object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* length() - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* concurrency - an integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a queue is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* push(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the queue, the callback is called\n  once the worker has finished processing the task.\n  instead of a single task, an array of tasks can be submitted. the respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* saturated - a callback that is called when the queue length hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued\n* empty - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue is given to a worker\n* drain - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue has returned from the worker\n\n__Example__\n\n    // create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\n    var q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n        console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n        callback();\n    }, 2);\n\n\n    // assign a callback\n    q.drain = function() {\n        console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n    }\n\n    // add some items to the queue\n\n    q.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n    });\n    q.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n    });\n\n    // add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\n    q.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n        console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n    });\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running functions based on their requirements.\nEach function can optionally depend on other functions being completed first,\nand each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. If any of\nthe functions pass an error to their callback, that function will not complete\n(so any other functions depending on it will not run) and the main callback\nwill be called immediately with the error. Functions also receive an object\ncontaining the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An object literal containing named functions or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The key\n  used for each function or array is used when specifying requirements. The\n  syntax is easier to understand by looking at the example.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. The callback will receive an error as an argument\n  if any tasks pass an error to their callback. If all tasks complete\n  successfully, it will receive an object containing their results.\n\n__Example__\n\n    async.auto({\n        get_data: function(callback){\n            // async code to get some data\n        },\n        make_folder: function(callback){\n            // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n            // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        },\n        write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback){\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            callback(null, filename);\n        }],\n        email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        }]\n    });\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            // async code to get some data\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n            // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        }\n    ],\n    function(results){\n        async.series([\n            function(callback){\n                // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n                // write the data to a file in the directory\n            },\n            email_link: function(callback){\n                // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            }\n        ]);\n    });\n\nFor a complicated series of async tasks using the auto function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier and makes the code more readable.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. Its also possible to\n\'peek\' the next iterator by doing iterator.next().\n\nThis function is used internally by the async module but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback it\n  must call on completion.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var iterator = async.iterator([\n        function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n        function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n        function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n    ]);\n\n    node> var iterator2 = iterator();\n    \'one\'\n    node> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n    \'two\'\n    node> iterator3();\n    \'three\'\n    node> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\n    node> nextfn();\n    \'three\'\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied, a useful\nshorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n    // using apply\n\n    async.parallel([\n        async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n        async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n    ]);\n\n\n    // the same process without using apply\n\n    async.parallel([\n        function(callback){\n            fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n        },\n    ]);\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n    node> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\n    node> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\n    one\n    two\n    three\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls the callback on a later loop around the event loop. In node.js this just\ncalls process.nextTick, in the browser it falls back to setTimeout(callback, 0),\nwhich means other higher priority events may precede the execution of the callback.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* callback - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var call_order = [];\n    async.nextTick(function(){\n        call_order.push(\'two\');\n        // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two]\n    });\n    call_order.push(\'one\')\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the function you to proxy and cache results from.\n* hasher - an optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results, it has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n        // do something\n        callback(null, result);\n    };\n    var fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n    // fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\n    fn(\'some name\', function () {\n        // callback\n    });\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a memoized function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Comes handy in tests.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.log and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.log is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var hello = function(name, callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n        }, 1000);\n    };\n\n    node> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n    \'hello world\'\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console using console.dir to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.dir and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.dir is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n    var hello = function(name, callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, {hello: name});\n        }, 1000);\n    };\n\n    node> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n    {hello: \'world\'}\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of async back to its original value, returning a reference to the\nasync object.\n',

The parse method uses the eval method to do the\nparsing, guarding it with several regular expressions to defend against\naccidental code execution hazards. On current browsers, this file does nothing,\nprefering the built-in JSON object.\n\njson.js: This file does everything that json2.js does.

52892 silly resolved     readme: '# Request -- Simplified HTTP request method\n\n## Install\n\n<pre>\n  npm install request\n</pre>\n\nOr from source:\n\n<pre>\n  git clone git://github.com/mikeal/request.git \n  cd request\n  npm link\n</pre>\n\n## Super simple to use\n\nRequest is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```javascript\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types, in this case `application/json`, and use the proper content-type in the PUT request if one is not already provided in the headers.\n\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also pipe to itself. When doing so the content-type and content-length will be preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let\'s get fancy.\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    } \n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also pipe() from a http.ServerRequest instance and to a http.ServerResponse instance. The HTTP method and headers will be sent as well as the entity-body data. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since pipe() returns the destination stream in node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying :)\n\n```javascript\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n```javascript\n// Twitter OAuth\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Assume by some stretch of magic you aquired the verifier\n  var access_token = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth = \n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: access_token.oauth_token\n      , verifier: VERIFIER\n      , token_secret: access_token.oauth_token_secret\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    var perm_token = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth = \n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_token.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_token.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json?\'\n      , params = \n        { screen_name: perm_token.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_token.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    url += qs.stringify(params)\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a url or an options object. The only required option is uri, all others are optional.\n\n* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from url.parse()\n* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the uri\n* `method` - http method, defaults to GET\n* `headers` - http headers, defaults to {}\n* `body` - entity body for POST and PUT requests. Must be buffer or string.\n* `form` - sets `body` but to querystring representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8` header.\n* `json` - sets `body` but to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.\n* `multipart` - (experimental) array of objects which contains their own headers and `body` attribute. Sends `multipart/related` request. See example below.\n* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to true.\n* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to false.\n* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow, defaults to 10.\n* `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If set to `null`, the body is returned as a Buffer.\n* `pool` - A hash object containing the agents for these requests. If omitted this request will use the global pool which is set to node\'s default maxSockets.\n* `pool.maxSockets` - Integer containing the maximum amount of sockets in the pool.\n* `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request\t\n* `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Support proxy Auth with Basic Auth the same way it\'s supported with the `url` parameter by embedding the auth info in the uri.\n* `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing, see documentation above.\n* `strictSSL` - Set to `true` to require that SSL certificates be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that ca as an option.\n* `jar` - Set to `false` if you don\'t want cookies to be remembered for future use or define your custom cookie jar (see examples section)\n\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments. The first is an error when applicable (usually from the http.Client option not the http.ClientRequest object). The second in an http.ClientResponse object. The third is the response body String or Buffer.\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n### request.defaults(options)  \n  \nThis method returns a wrapper around the normal request API that defaults to whatever options you pass in to it.\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.del(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nAlias to normal request method for uniformity.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.cookie(\'cookie_string_here\')\n```\n### request.jar\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart: \n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ] \n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\nCookies are enabled by default (so they can be used in subsequent requests). To disable cookies set jar to false (either in defaults or in the options sent).\n\n```javascript\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: false})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nIf you to use a custom cookie jar (instead of letting request use its own global cookie jar) you do so by setting the jar default or by specifying it as an option:\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\nOR\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'your_cookie_here\')\nj.add(cookie)\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n',

52892 silly resolved     readme: '# stack-trace\n\nGet v8 stack traces as an array of CallSite objects.\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\nnpm install stack-trace\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe stack-trace module makes it easy for you to capture the current stack:\n\n``` javascript\nvar stackTrace = require(\'stack-trace\');\nvar trace = stackTrace.get();\n\nrequire(\'assert\').strictEqual(trace[0].getFileName(), __filename);\n```\n\nHowever, sometimes you have already popped the stack you are interested in,\nand all you have left is an `Error` object. This module can help:\n\n``` javascript\nvar stackTrace = require(\'stack-trace\');\nvar err = new Error(\'something went wrong\');\nvar trace = stackTrace.parse(err);\n\nrequire(\'assert\').strictEqual(trace[0].getFileName(), __filename);\n```\n\nPlease note that parsing the `Error#stack` property is not perfect, only\ncertain properties can be retrieved with it as noted in the API docs below.\n\n## Long stack traces\n\nstack-trace works great with [long-stack-traces][], when parsing an `err.stack`\nthat has crossed the event loop boundary, a `CallSite` object returning\n`\'----------------------------------------\'` for `getFileName()` is created.\nAll other methods of the event loop boundary call site return `null`.\n\n[long-stack-traces]: https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces\n\n## API\n\n### stackTrace.get([belowFn])\n\nReturns an array of `CallSite` objects, where element `0` is the current call\nsite.\n\nWhen passing a function on the current stack as the `belowFn` parameter, the\nreturned array will only include `CallSite` objects below this function.\n\n### stackTrace.parse(err)\n\nParses the `err.stack` property of an `Error` object into an array compatible\nwith those returned by `stackTrace.get()`. However, only the following methods\nare implemented on the returned `CallSite` objects.\n\n* getTypeName\n* getFunctionName\n* getMethodName\n* getFileName\n* getLineNumber\n* getColumnNumber\n* isNative\n\nNote: Except `getFunctionName()`, all of the above methods return exactly the\nsame values as you would get from `stackTrace.get()`. `getFunctionName()`\nis sometimes a little different, but still useful.\n\n### CallSite\n\nThe official v8 CallSite object API can be found [here][v8stackapi]. A quick\nexcerpt:\n\n> A CallSite object defines the following methods:\n>\n> * **getThis**: returns the value of this\n> * **getTypeName**: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object\'s [[Class]] internal property.\n> * **getFunction**: returns the current function\n> * **getFunctionName**: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function\'s context.\n> * **getMethodName**: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function\n> * **getFileName**: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script\n> * **getLineNumber**: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number\n> * **getColumnNumber**: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number\n> * **getEvalOrigin**: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called\n> * **isToplevel**: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?\n> * **isEval**: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?\n> * **isNative**: is this call in native V8 code?\n> * **isConstructor**: is this a constructor call?\n\n[v8stackapi]: http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi\n\n## License\n\nstack-trace is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

52892 silly resolved     readme: 'eyes\n====\n\na customizable value inspector for Node.js\n\nsynopsis\n--------\n\nI was tired of looking at cluttered output in the console -- something needed to be done,\n`sys.inspect()` didn\'t display regexps correctly, and was too verbose, and I had an hour or two to spare. \nSo I decided to have some fun. _eyes_ were born.\n\n![eyes-ss](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/251849/eyes-js-ss.gif)\n\n_example of the output of a user-customized eyes.js inspector_\n\n*eyes* also deals with circular objects in an intelligent way, and can pretty-print object literals.\n\nusage\n-----\n\n    var inspect = require(\'eyes\').inspector({styles: {all: \'magenta\'}});\n\n    inspect(something); // inspect with the settings passed to `inspector`\n\nor\n\n    var eyes = require(\'eyes\');\n\n    eyes.inspect(something); // inspect with the default settings\n\nyou can pass a _label_ to `inspect()`, to keep track of your inspections:\n\n    eyes.inspect(something, "a random value");\n\nIf you want to return the output of eyes without printing it, you can set it up this way:\n\n    var inspect = require(\'eyes\').inspector({ stream: null });\n\n    sys.puts(inspect({ something: 42 }));\n\ncustomization\n-------------\n\nThese are the default styles and settings used by _eyes_.\n\n    styles: {                 // Styles applied to stdout\n        all:     \'cyan\',      // Overall style applied to everything\n        label:   \'underline\', // Inspection labels, like \'array\' in `array: [1, 2, 3]`\n        other:   \'inverted\',  // Objects which don\'t have a literal representation, such as functions\n        key:     \'bold\',      // The keys in object literals, like \'a\' in `{a: 1}`\n        special: \'grey\',      // null, undefined...\n        string:  \'green\',\n        number:  \'magenta\',\n        bool:    \'blue\',      // true false\n        regexp:  \'green\',     // /\\d+/\n    },\n    \n    pretty: true,             // Indent object literals\n    hideFunctions: false,     // Don\'t output functions at all\n    stream: process.stdout,   // Stream to write to, or null\n    maxLength: 2048           // Truncate output if longer\n\nYou can overwrite them with your own, by passing a similar object to `inspector()` or `inspect()`.\n\n    var inspect = require(\'eyes\').inspector({\n        styles: {\n            all: \'magenta\',\n            special: \'bold\'\n        },\n        maxLength: 512\n    });\n\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

53938 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

54243 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about bind, not about async. If you are wondering how to\nmake async execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5.

If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main\ncallback for the each function is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit null argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as each only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n<a name="eachLimit" />\n### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as each only no more than "limit" iterators will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that\n the first "limit" iterator functions will complete before any others are \nstarted.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* limit - The maximum number of iterators to run at any time.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit null argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in the given array through\nthe iterator function. The iterator is called with an item from the array and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. The callback takes 2 arguments, \nan error and the transformed item from the array. If the iterator passes an\nerror to this callback, the main callback for the map function is immediately\ncalled with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order, however\nthe results array will be in the same order as the original array.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original array.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as map only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing.

Memo is the initial state of the reduction. This\nfunction only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to\nsplit a call to this function into a parallel map, then use the normal\nArray.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where\neach step in the reduction needs to be async, if you can get the data before\nreducing it then it\'s probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* memo - The initial state of the reduction.\n* iterator(memo, item, callback) - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iterator is passed a\n  callback(err, reduction) which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main callback is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* callback(err, result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ foldr\n\nSame as reduce, only operates on the items in the array in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in a list that passes an async truth test.

Once the tasks have completed,\nthe results are passed to the final callback as an array.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array.

Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the payload limit). If the\nworker is in progress, the task is queued until it is available. Once\nthe worker has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* worker(tasks, callback) - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its callback(err) argument when finished, with \n  an optional error as an argument.\n* payload - An optional integer for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe cargo object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* length() - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* payload - an integer for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a cargo is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* push(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the queue, the callback is called\n  once the worker has finished processing the task.\n  instead of a single task, an array of tasks can be submitted. the respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* saturated - a callback that is called when the queue length hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued\n* empty - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue is given to a worker\n* drain - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue has returned from the worker\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running functions based on their requirements.\nEach function can optionally depend on other functions being completed first,\nand each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. If any of\nthe functions pass an error to their callback, that function will not complete\n(so any other functions depending on it will not run) and the main callback\nwill be called immediately with the error. Functions also receive an object\ncontaining the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a results object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the tasks object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. For example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling readFile with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to readFile in a function which does not forward the \nresults object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An object literal containing named functions or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The key\n  used for each function or array is used when specifying requirements. The \n  function receives two arguments: (1) a callback(err, result) which must be \n  called when finished, passing an error (which can be null) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a results object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. The callback will receive an error as an argument\n  if any tasks pass an error to their callback. Results will always be passed\n\tbut if an error occurred, no other tasks will be performed, and the results\n\tobject will only contain partial results.\n  \n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        // async code to get some data\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback){\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, filename);\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n    }]\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        // async code to get some data\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of async tasks using the auto function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier and makes the code more readable.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n\'peek\' the next iterator by doing iterator.next().\n\nThis function is used internally by the async module but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied, a useful\nshorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls the callback on a later loop around the event loop. In node.js this just\ncalls process.nextTick, in the browser it falls back to setImmediate(callback)\nif available, otherwise setTimeout(callback, 0), which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of the callback.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* callback - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the callback n times and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with async.map.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* n - The number of times to run the function.\n* callback - The function to call n times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as times only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the function you to proxy and cache results from.\n* hasher - an optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results, it has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a memoized function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Comes handy in tests.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.log and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.log is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console using console.dir to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.dir and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.dir is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of async back to its original value, returning a reference to the\nasync object.\n',

54243 silly resolved     readme: '# ncp - Asynchronous recursive file & directory copying\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AvianFlu/ncp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/AvianFlu/ncp)\n\nThink `cp -r`, but pure node, and asynchronous.  `ncp` can be used both as a CLI tool and programmatically.\n\n## Command Line usage\n\nUsage is simple: `ncp [source] [dest] [--limit=concurrency limit]\n[--filter=filter] --stopOnErr`\n\nThe \'filter\' is a Regular Expression - matched files will be copied.\n\nThe \'concurrency limit\' is an integer that represents how many pending file system requests `ncp` has at a time.\n\n\'stopOnErr\' is a boolean flag that will tell `ncp` to stop immediately if any\nerrors arise, rather than attempting to continue while logging errors.\n\nIf there are no errors, `ncp` will output `done.` when complete.  If there are errors, the error messages will be logged to `stdout` and to `./ncp-debug.log`, and the copy operation will attempt to continue.\n\n## Programmatic usage\n\nProgrammatic usage of `ncp` is just as simple.  The only argument to the completion callback is a possible error.  \n\n```javascript\nvar ncp = require(\'ncp\').ncp;\n\nncp.limit = 16;\n\nncp(source, destination, function (err) {\n if (err) {\n   return console.error(err);\n }\n console.log(\'done!\');\n});\n```\n\nYou can also call ncp like `ncp(source, destination, options, callback)`. \n`options` should be a dictionary. Currently, such options are available:\n\n  * `options.filter` - a `RegExp` instance, against which each file name is\n  tested to determine whether to copy it or not, or a function taking single\n  parameter: copied file name, returning `true` or `false`, determining\n  whether to copy file or not.\n\n  * `options.transform` - a function: `function (read, write) { read.pipe(write) }`\n  used to apply streaming transforms while copying.\n\n  * `options.clobber` - boolean=true. if set to false, `ncp` will not overwrite \n  destination files that already exist.\n\nPlease open an issue if any bugs arise.  As always, I accept (working) pull requests, and refunds are available at `/dev/null`.\n',

Certain\nerrors are handled for you:\n\n* Windows: `EBUSY` and `ENOTEMPTY` - rimraf will back off a maximum of\n  `opts.maxBusyTries` times before giving up.\n* `ENOENT` - If the file doesn\'t exist, rimraf will return\n  successfully, since your desired outcome is already the case.\n\n## rimraf.sync\n\nIt can remove stuff synchronously, too.  But that\'s not so good.  Use\nthe async API.  It\'s better.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf installed with `npm install rimraf -g` it can be used as a global\ncommand `rimraf <path>` which is useful for cross platform support.\n\n## mkdirp\n\nIf you need to create a directory recursively, check out\n[mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp).\n',

55218 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

55347 silly resolved     readme: '# debuglog - backport of util.debuglog() from node v0.11\n\nTo facilitate using the `util.debuglog()` function that will be available when\nnode v0.12 is released now, this is a copy extracted from the source.\n\n## require(\'debuglog\')\n\nReturn `util.debuglog`, if it exists, otherwise it will return an internal copy\nof the implementation from node v0.11.\n\n## debuglog(section)\n\n* `section` {String} The section of the program to be debugged\n* Returns: {Function} The logging function\n\nThis is used to create a function which conditionally writes to stderr\nbased on the existence of a `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable.  If the\n`section` name appears in that environment variable, then the returned\nfunction will be similar to `console.error()`.  If not, then the\nreturned function is a no-op.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nvar debuglog = util.debuglog(\'foo\');\n\nvar bar = 123;\ndebuglog(\'hello from foo [%d]\', bar);\n```\n\nIf this program is run with `NODE_DEBUG=foo` in the environment, then\nit will output something like:\n\n    FOO 3245: hello from foo [123]\n\nwhere `3245` is the process id.  If it is not run with that\nenvironment variable set, then it will not print anything.\n\nYou may separate multiple `NODE_DEBUG` environment variables with a\ncomma.  For example, `NODE_DEBUG=fs,net,tls`.\n',

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource\'s line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source)\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file\'s line/column order or the\n  original\'s source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource\'s line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren\'t in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `\'.\'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn\'t associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn\'t associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source\'s filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source\'s line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node\'s children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with "test", for example\n\n    exports["test doing the foo bar"] = function (assert, util) {\n      ...\n    };\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node\'s assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox\'s test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice\n',

56474 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

56626 silly resolved     readme: '## LOL, WUT?\nIt basically allows you to allow or disallow Flash Player sockets from accessing your site.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install policyfile\n```\n## Usage\n\nThe server is based on the regular and know `net` and `http` server patterns. So it you can just listen\nfor all the events that a `net` based server emits etc. But there is one extra event, the `connect_failed`\nevent. This event is triggered when we are unable to listen on the supplied port number.\n\n### createServer\nCreates a new server instance and accepts 2 optional arguments:\n\n-  `options` **Object** Options to configure the server instance\n    -  `log` **Boolean** Enable logging to STDOUT and STDERR (defaults to true)\n-  `origins` **Array** An Array of origins that are allowed by the server (defaults to *:*)\n\n```js\nvar pf = require(\'policyfile\');\npf.createServer();\npf.listen();\n```\n\n#### server.listen\nStart listening on the server and it takes 3 optional arguments\n\n-  `port` **Number** On which port number should we listen? (defaults to 843, which is the first port number the FlashPlayer checks)\n-  `server` **Server** A http server, if we are unable to accept requests or run the server we can also answer the policy requests inline over the supplied HTTP server.\n-  `callback` **Function** A callback function that is called when listening to the server was successful.\n\n```js\nvar pf = require(\'policyfile\');\npf.createServer();\npf.listen(1337, function(){\n  console.log(\':3 yay\')\n});\n```\n\nChanging port numbers can be handy if you do not want to run your server as root and have port 843 forward to a non root port number (aka a number above 1024).\n\n```js\nvar pf = require(\'policyfile\')\n  , http = require(\'http\');\n\nserver = http.createServer(function(q,r){r.writeHead(200);r.end(\'hello world\')});\nserver.listen(80);\n\npf.createServer();\npf.listen(1337, server, function(){\n  console.log(\':3 yay\')\n});\n```\n\nSupport for serving inline requests over a existing HTTP connection as the FlashPlayer will first check port 843, but if it\'s unable to get a response there it will send a policy file request over port 80, which is usually your http server.\n\n#### server.add\nAdds more origins to the policy file you can add as many arguments as you like.\n\n```js\nvar pf = require(\'policyfile\');\npf.createServer([\'google.com:80\']);\npf.listen();\npf.add(\'blog.3rd-Eden.com:80\', \'blog.3rd-Eden.com:8080\'); // now has 3 origins\n```\n\n#### server.add\nAdds more origins to the policy file you can add as many arguments as you like.\n\n```js\nvar pf = require(\'policyfile\');\npf.createServer([\'blog.3rd-Eden.com:80\', \'blog.3rd-Eden.com:8080\']);\npf.listen();\npf.remove(\'blog.3rd-Eden.com:8080\'); // only contains the :80 version now\n```\n\n#### server.close\nShuts down the server\n\n```js\nvar pf = require(\'policyfile\');\npf.createServer();\npf.listen();\npf.close(); // OH NVM.\n```\n\n## API\nhttp://3rd-eden.com/FlashPolicyFileServer/\n\n## Examples\nSee https://github.com/3rd-Eden/FlashPolicyFileServer/tree/master/examples for examples\n\n## Licence\n\nMIT see LICENSE file in the repository',

56626 silly resolved     readme: 'redis - a node.js redis client\n===========================\n\nThis is a complete Redis client for node.js.  It supports all Redis commands, including many recently added commands like EVAL from\nexperimental Redis server branches.\n\n\nInstall with:\n\n    npm install redis\n\nPieter Noordhuis has provided a binding to the official `hiredis` C library, which is non-blocking and fast.  To use `hiredis`, do:\n\n    npm install hiredis redis\n\nIf `hiredis` is installed, `node_redis` will use it by default.  Otherwise, a pure JavaScript parser will be used.\n\nIf you use `hiredis`, be sure to rebuild it whenever you upgrade your version of node.  There are mysterious failures that can\nhappen between node and native code modules after a node upgrade.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSimple example, included as `examples/simple.js`:\n\n```js\n    var redis = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient();\n\n    // if you\'d like to select database 3, instead of 0 (default), call\n    // client.select(3, function() { /* ... */ });\n\n    client.on("error", function (err) {\n        console.log("Error " + err);\n    });\n\n    client.set("string key", "string val", redis.print);\n    client.hset("hash key", "hashtest 1", "some value", redis.print);\n    client.hset(["hash key", "hashtest 2", "some other value"], redis.print);\n    client.hkeys("hash key", function (err, replies) {\n        console.log(replies.length + " replies:");\n        replies.forEach(function (reply, i) {\n            console.log("    " + i + ": " + reply);\n        });\n        client.quit();\n    });\n```\n\nThis will display:\n\n    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js\n    Reply: OK\n    Reply: 0\n    Reply: 0\n    2 replies:\n        0: hashtest 1\n        1: hashtest 2\n    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$\n\n\n## Performance\n\nHere are typical results of `multi_bench.js` which is similar to `redis-benchmark` from the Redis distribution.\nIt uses 50 concurrent connections with no pipelining.\n\nJavaScript parser:\n\n    PING: 20000 ops 42283.30 ops/sec 0/5/1.182\n    SET: 20000 ops 32948.93 ops/sec 1/7/1.515\n    GET: 20000 ops 28694.40 ops/sec 0/9/1.740\n    INCR: 20000 ops 39370.08 ops/sec 0/8/1.269\n    LPUSH: 20000 ops 36429.87 ops/sec 0/8/1.370\n    LRANGE (10 elements): 20000 ops 9891.20 ops/sec 1/9/5.048\n    LRANGE (100 elements): 20000 ops 1384.56 ops/sec 10/91/36.072\n\nhiredis parser:\n\n    PING: 20000 ops 46189.38 ops/sec 1/4/1.082\n    SET: 20000 ops 41237.11 ops/sec 0/6/1.210\n    GET: 20000 ops 39682.54 ops/sec 1/7/1.257\n    INCR: 20000 ops 40080.16 ops/sec 0/8/1.242\n    LPUSH: 20000 ops 41152.26 ops/sec 0/3/1.212\n    LRANGE (10 elements): 20000 ops 36563.07 ops/sec 1/8/1.363\n    LRANGE (100 elements): 20000 ops 21834.06 ops/sec 0/9/2.287\n\nThe performance of `node_redis` improves dramatically with pipelining, which happens automatically in most normal programs.\n\n\n### Sending Commands\n\nEach Redis command is exposed as a function on the `client` object.\nAll functions take either an `args` Array plus optional `callback` Function or\na variable number of individual arguments followed by an optional callback.\nHere is an example of passing an array of arguments and a callback:\n\n    client.mset(["test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2"], function (err, res) {});\n\nHere is that same call in the second style:\n\n    client.mset("test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2", function (err, res) {});\n\nNote that in either form the `callback` is optional:\n\n    client.set("some key", "some val");\n    client.set(["some other key", "some val"]);\n\nIf the key is missing, reply will be null (probably):\n\n    client.get("missingkey", function(err, reply) {\n        // reply is null when the key is missing\n        console.log(reply);\n    });\n\nFor a list of Redis commands, see [Redis Command Reference](http://redis.io/commands)\n\nThe commands can be specified in uppercase or lowercase for convenience.  `client.get()` is the same as `client.GET()`.\n\nMinimal parsing is done on the replies.  Commands that return a single line reply return JavaScript Strings,\ninteger replies return JavaScript Numbers, "bulk" replies return node Buffers, and "multi bulk" replies return a\nJavaScript Array of node Buffers.  `HGETALL` returns an Object with Buffers keyed by the hash keys.\n\n# API\n\n## Connection Events\n\n`client` will emit some events about the state of the connection to the Redis server.\n\n### "ready"\n\n`client` will emit `ready` a connection is established to the Redis server and the server reports\nthat it is ready to receive commands.  Commands issued before the `ready` event are queued,\nthen replayed just before this event is emitted.\n\n### "connect"\n\n`client` will emit `connect` at the same time as it emits `ready` unless `client.options.no_ready_check`\nis set.  If this options is set, `connect` will be emitted when the stream is connected, and then\nyou are free to try to send commands.\n\n### "error"\n\n`client` will emit `error` when encountering an error connecting to the Redis server.\n\nNote that "error" is a special event type in node.  If there are no listeners for an\n"error" event, node will exit.  This is usually what you want, but it can lead to some\ncryptic error messages like this:\n\n    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js\n\n    node.js:50\n        throw e;\n        ^\n    Error: ECONNREFUSED, Connection refused\n        at IOWatcher.callback (net:870:22)\n        at node.js:607:9\n\nNot very useful in diagnosing the problem, but if your program isn\'t ready to handle this,\nit is probably the right thing to just exit.\n\n`client` will also emit `error` if an exception is thrown inside of `node_redis` for whatever reason.\nIt would be nice to distinguish these two cases.\n\n### "end"\n\n`client` will emit `end` when an established Redis server connection has closed.\n\n### "drain"\n\n`client` will emit `drain` when the TCP connection to the Redis server has been buffering, but is now\nwritable.  This event can be used to stream commands in to Redis and adapt to backpressure.  Right now,\nyou need to check `client.command_queue.length` to decide when to reduce your send rate.  Then you can\nresume sending when you get `drain`.\n\n### "idle"\n\n`client` will emit `idle` when there are no outstanding commands that are awaiting a response.\n\n## redis.createClient(port, host, options)\n\nCreate a new client connection.  `port` defaults to `6379` and `host` defaults\nto `127.0.0.1`.  If you have `redis-server` running on the same computer as node, then the defaults for\nport and host are probably fine.  `options` in an object with the following possible properties:\n\n* `parser`: which Redis protocol reply parser to use.  Defaults to `hiredis` if that module is installed.\nThis may also be set to `javascript`.\n* `return_buffers`: defaults to `false`.  If set to `true`, then all replies will be sent to callbacks as node Buffer\nobjects instead of JavaScript Strings.\n* `detect_buffers`: default to `false`. If set to `true`, then replies will be sent to callbacks as node Buffer objects\nif any of the input arguments to the original command were Buffer objects.\nThis option lets you switch between Buffers and Strings on a per-command basis, whereas `return_buffers` applies to\nevery command on a client.\n* `socket_nodelay`: defaults to `true`. Whether to call setNoDelay() on the TCP stream, which disables the\nNagle algorithm on the underlying socket.  Setting this option to `false` can result in additional throughput at the\ncost of more latency.  Most applications will want this set to `true`.\n* `no_ready_check`: defaults to `false`. When a connection is established to the Redis server, the server might still\nbe loading the database from disk.  While loading, the server not respond to any commands.  To work around this,\n`node_redis` has a "ready check" which sends the `INFO` command to the server.  The response from the `INFO` command\nindicates whether the server is ready for more commands.  When ready, `node_redis` emits a `ready` event.\nSetting `no_ready_check` to `true` will inhibit this check.\n* `enable_offline_queue`: defaults to `true`. By default, if there is no active\nconnection to the redis server, commands are added to a queue and are executed\nonce the connection has been established. Setting `enable_offline_queue` to\n`false` will disable this feature and the callback will be execute immediately\nwith an error, or an error will be thrown if no callback is specified.\n\n```js\n    var redis = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient(null, null, {detect_buffers: true});\n\n    client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "OK");\n\n    // This will return a JavaScript String\n    client.get("foo_rand000000000000", function (err, reply) {\n        console.log(reply.toString()); // Will print `OK`\n    });\n\n    // This will return a Buffer since original key is specified as a Buffer\n    client.get(new Buffer("foo_rand000000000000"), function (err, reply) {\n        console.log(reply.toString()); // Will print `<Buffer 4f 4b>`\n    });\n    client.end();\n```\n\n`createClient()` returns a `RedisClient` object that is named `client` in all of the examples here.\n\n## client.auth(password, callback)\n\nWhen connecting to Redis servers that require authentication, the `AUTH` command must be sent as the\nfirst command after connecting.  This can be tricky to coordinate with reconnections, the ready check,\netc.  To make this easier, `client.auth()` stashes `password` and will send it after each connection,\nincluding reconnections.  `callback` is invoked only once, after the response to the very first\n`AUTH` command sent.\nNOTE: Your call to `client.auth()` should not be inside the ready handler. If\nyou are doing this wrong, `client` will emit an error that looks\nsomething like this `Error: Ready check failed: ERR operation not permitted`.\n\n## client.end()\n\nForcibly close the connection to the Redis server.  Note that this does not wait until all replies have been parsed.\nIf you want to exit cleanly, call `client.quit()` to send the `QUIT` command after you have handled all replies.\n\nThis example closes the connection to the Redis server before the replies have been read.  You probably don\'t\nwant to do this:\n\n```js\n    var redis = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient();\n\n    client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value");\n    client.get("foo_rand000000000000", function (err, reply) {\n        console.log(reply.toString());\n    });\n    client.end();\n```\n\n`client.end()` is useful for timeout cases where something is stuck or taking too long and you want\nto start over.\n\n## Friendlier hash commands\n\nMost Redis commands take a single String or an Array of Strings as arguments, and replies are sent back as a single String or an Array of Strings.\nWhen dealing with hash values, there are a couple of useful exceptions to this.\n\n### client.hgetall(hash)\n\nThe reply from an HGETALL command will be converted into a JavaScript Object by `node_redis`.  That way you can interact\nwith the responses using JavaScript syntax.\n\nExample:\n\n    client.hmset("hosts", "mjr", "1", "another", "23", "home", "1234");\n    client.hgetall("hosts", function (err, obj) {\n        console.dir(obj);\n    });\n\nOutput:\n\n    { mjr: \'1\', another: \'23\', home: \'1234\' }\n\n### client.hmset(hash, obj, [callback])\n\nMultiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object:\n\n    client.HMSET(key2, {\n        "0123456789": "abcdefghij", // NOTE: the key and value must both be strings\n        "some manner of key": "a type of value"\n    });\n\nThe properties and values of this Object will be set as keys and values in the Redis hash.\n\n### client.hmset(hash, key1, val1, ... keyn, valn, [callback])\n\nMultiple values may also be set by supplying a list:\n\n    client.HMSET(key1, "0123456789", "abcdefghij", "some manner of key", "a type of value");\n\n\n## Publish / Subscribe\n\nHere is a simple example of the API for publish / subscribe.  This program opens two\nclient connections, subscribes to a channel on one of them, and publishes to that\nchannel on the other:\n\n```js\n    var redis = require("redis"),\n        client1 = redis.createClient(), client2 = redis.createClient(),\n        msg_count = 0;\n\n    client1.on("subscribe", function (channel, count) {\n        client2.publish("a nice channel", "I am sending a message.");\n        client2.publish("a nice channel", "I am sending a second message.");\n        client2.publish("a nice channel", "I am sending my last message.");\n    });\n\n    client1.on("message", function (channel, message) {\n        console.log("client1 channel " + channel + ": " + message);\n        msg_count += 1;\n        if (msg_count === 3) {\n            client1.unsubscribe();\n            client1.end();\n            client2.end();\n        }\n    });\n\n    client1.incr("did a thing");\n    client1.subscribe("a nice channel");\n```\n\nWhen a client issues a `SUBSCRIBE` or `PSUBSCRIBE`, that connection is put into "pub/sub" mode.\nAt that point, only commands that modify the subscription set are valid.  When the subscription\nset is empty, the connection is put back into regular mode.\n\nIf you need to send regular commands to Redis while in pub/sub mode, just open another connection.\n\n## Pub / Sub Events\n\nIf a client has subscriptions active, it may emit these events:\n\n### "message" (channel, message)\n\nClient will emit `message` for every message received that matches an active subscription.\nListeners are passed the channel name as `channel` and the message Buffer as `message`.\n\n### "pmessage" (pattern, channel, message)\n\nClient will emit `pmessage` for every message received that matches an active subscription pattern.\nListeners are passed the original pattern used with `PSUBSCRIBE` as `pattern`, the sending channel\nname as `channel`, and the message Buffer as `message`.\n\n### "subscribe" (channel, count)\n\nClient will emit `subscribe` in response to a `SUBSCRIBE` command.  Listeners are passed the\nchannel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`.\n\n### "psubscribe" (pattern, count)\n\nClient will emit `psubscribe` in response to a `PSUBSCRIBE` command.  Listeners are passed the\noriginal pattern as `pattern`, and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`.\n\n### "unsubscribe" (channel, count)\n\nClient will emit `unsubscribe` in response to a `UNSUBSCRIBE` command.  Listeners are passed the\nchannel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`.  When\n`count` is 0, this client has left pub/sub mode and no more pub/sub events will be emitted.\n\n### "punsubscribe" (pattern, count)\n\nClient will emit `punsubscribe` in response to a `PUNSUBSCRIBE` command.  Listeners are passed the\nchannel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`.  When\n`count` is 0, this client has left pub/sub mode and no more pub/sub events will be emitted.\n\n## client.multi([commands])\n\n`MULTI` commands are queued up until an `EXEC` is issued, and then all commands are run atomically by\nRedis.  The interface in `node_redis` is to return an individual `Multi` object by calling `client.multi()`.\n\n```js\n    var redis  = require("./index"),\n        client = redis.createClient(), set_size = 20;\n\n    client.sadd("bigset", "a member");\n    client.sadd("bigset", "another member");\n\n    while (set_size > 0) {\n        client.sadd("bigset", "member " + set_size);\n        set_size -= 1;\n    }\n\n    // multi chain with an individual callback\n    client.multi()\n        .scard("bigset")\n        .smembers("bigset")\n        .keys("*", function (err, replies) {\n            // NOTE: code in this callback is NOT atomic\n            // this only happens after the the .exec call finishes.\n            client.mget(replies, redis.print);\n        })\n        .dbsize()\n        .exec(function (err, replies) {\n            console.log("MULTI got " + replies.length + " replies");\n            replies.forEach(function (reply, index) {\n                console.log("Reply " + index + ": " + reply.toString());\n            });\n        });\n```\n\n`client.multi()` is a constructor that returns a `Multi` object.  `Multi` objects share all of the\nsame command methods as `client` objects do.  Commands are queued up inside the `Multi` object\nuntil `Multi.exec()` is invoked.\n\nYou can either chain together `MULTI` commands as in the above example, or you can queue individual\ncommands while still sending regular client command as in this example:\n\n```js\n    var redis  = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient(), multi;\n\n    // start a separate multi command queue\n    multi = client.multi();\n    multi.incr("incr thing", redis.print);\n    multi.incr("incr other thing", redis.print);\n\n    // runs immediately\n    client.mset("incr thing", 100, "incr other thing", 1, redis.print);\n\n    // drains multi queue and runs atomically\n    multi.exec(function (err, replies) {\n        console.log(replies); // 101, 2\n    });\n\n    // you can re-run the same transaction if you like\n    multi.exec(function (err, replies) {\n        console.log(replies); // 102, 3\n        client.quit();\n    });\n```\n\nIn addition to adding commands to the `MULTI` queue individually, you can also pass an array\nof commands and arguments to the constructor:\n\n```js\n    var redis  = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient(), multi;\n\n    client.multi([\n        ["mget", "multifoo", "multibar", redis.print],\n        ["incr", "multifoo"],\n        ["incr", "multibar"]\n    ]).exec(function (err, replies) {\n        console.log(replies);\n    });\n```\n\n\n## Monitor mode\n\nRedis supports the `MONITOR` command, which lets you see all commands received by the Redis server\nacross all client connections, including from other client libraries and other computers.\n\nAfter you send the `MONITOR` command, no other commands are valid on that connection.  `node_redis`\nwill emit a `monitor` event for every new monitor message that comes across.  The callback for the\n`monitor` event takes a timestamp from the Redis server and an array of command arguments.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```js\n    var client  = require("redis").createClient(),\n        util = require("util");\n\n    client.monitor(function (err, res) {\n        console.log("Entering monitoring mode.");\n    });\n\n    client.on("monitor", function (time, args) {\n        console.log(time + ": " + util.inspect(args));\n    });\n```\n\n# Extras\n\nSome other things you might like to know about.\n\n## client.server_info\n\nAfter the ready probe completes, the results from the INFO command are saved in the `client.server_info`\nobject.\n\nThe `versions` key contains an array of the elements of the version string for easy comparison.\n\n    > client.server_info.redis_version\n    \'2.3.0\'\n    > client.server_info.versions\n    [ 2, 3, 0 ]\n\n## redis.print()\n\nA handy callback function for displaying return values when testing.  Example:\n\n```js\n    var redis = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient();\n\n    client.on("connect", function () {\n        client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value", redis.print);\n        client.get("foo_rand000000000000", redis.print);\n    });\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n    Reply: OK\n    Reply: some fantastic value\n\nNote that this program will not exit cleanly because the client is still connected.\n\n## redis.debug_mode\n\nBoolean to enable debug mode and protocol tracing.\n\n```js\n    var redis = require("redis"),\n        client = redis.createClient();\n\n    redis.debug_mode = true;\n\n    client.on("connect", function () {\n        client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value");\n    });\n```\n\nThis will display:\n\n    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node ~/example.js\n    send command: *3\n    $3\n    SET\n    $20\n    foo_rand000000000000\n    $20\n    some fantastic value\n\n    on_data: +OK\n\n`send command` is data sent into Redis and `on_data` is data received from Redis.\n\n## client.send_command(command_name, args, callback)\n\nUsed internally to send commands to Redis.  For convenience, nearly all commands that are published on the Redis\nWiki have been added to the `client` object.  However, if I missed any, or if new commands are introduced before\nthis library is updated, you can use `send_command()` to send arbitrary commands to Redis.\n\nAll commands are sent as multi-bulk commands.  `args` can either be an Array of arguments, or omitted.\n\n## client.connected\n\nBoolean tracking the state of the connection to the Redis server.\n\n## client.command_queue.length\n\nThe number of commands that have been sent to the Redis server but not yet replied to.  You can use this to\nenforce some kind of maximum queue depth for commands while connected.\n\nDon\'t mess with `client.command_queue` though unless you really know what you are doing.\n\n## client.offline_queue.length\n\nThe number of commands that have been queued up for a future connection.  You can use this to enforce\nsome kind of maximum queue depth for pre-connection commands.\n\n## client.retry_delay\n\nCurrent delay in milliseconds before a connection retry will be attempted.  This starts at `250`.\n\n## client.retry_backoff\n\nMultiplier for future retry timeouts.  This should be larger than 1 to add more time between retries.\nDefaults to 1.7.  The default initial connection retry is 250, so the second retry will be 425, followed by 723.5, etc.\n\n### Commands with Optional and Keyword arguments\n\nThis applies to anything that uses an optional `[WITHSCORES]` or `[LIMIT offset count]` in the [redis.io/commands](http://redis.io/commands) documentation.\n\nExample:\n```js\nvar args = [ \'myzset\', 1, \'one\', 2, \'two\', 3, \'three\', 99, \'ninety-nine\' ];\nclient.zadd(args, function (err, response) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'added \'+response+\' items.\');\n\n    // -Infinity and +Infinity also work\n    var args1 = [ \'myzset\', \'+inf\', \'-inf\' ];\n    client.zrevrangebyscore(args1, function (err, response) {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log(\'example1\', response);\n        // write your code here\n    });\n\n    var max = 3, min = 1, offset = 1, count = 2;\n    var args2 = [ \'myzset\', max, min, \'WITHSCORES\', \'LIMIT\', offset, count ];\n    client.zrevrangebyscore(args2, function (err, response) {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log(\'example2\', response);\n        // write your code here\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## TODO\n\nBetter tests for auth, disconnect/reconnect, and all combinations thereof.\n\nStream large set/get values into and out of Redis.  Otherwise the entire value must be in node\'s memory.\n\nPerformance can be better for very large values.\n\nI think there are more performance improvements left in there for smaller values, especially for large lists of small values.\n\n## How to Contribute\n- open a pull request and then wait for feedback (if\n  [DTrejo](http://github.com/dtrejo) does not get back to you within 2 days,\n  comment again with indignation!)\n\n## Contributors\nSome people have have added features and fixed bugs in `node_redis` other than me.\n\nOrdered by date of first contribution.\n[Auto-generated](http://github.com/dtrejo/node-authors) on Wed Jul 25 2012 19:14:59 GMT-0700 (PDT).\n\n- [Matt Ranney aka `mranney`](https://github.com/mranney)\n- [Tim-Smart aka `tim-smart`](https://github.com/tim-smart)\n- [Tj Holowaychuk aka `visionmedia`](https://github.com/visionmedia)\n- [rick aka `technoweenie`](https://github.com/technoweenie)\n- [Orion Henry aka `orionz`](https://github.com/orionz)\n- [Aivo Paas aka `aivopaas`](https://github.com/aivopaas)\n- [Hank Sims aka `hanksims`](https://github.com/hanksims)\n- [Paul Carey aka `paulcarey`](https://github.com/paulcarey)\n- [Pieter Noordhuis aka `pietern`](https://github.com/pietern)\n- [nithesh aka `nithesh`](https://github.com/nithesh)\n- [Andy Ray aka `andy2ray`](https://github.com/andy2ray)\n- [unknown aka `unknowdna`](https://github.com/unknowdna)\n- [Dave Hoover aka `redsquirrel`](https://github.com/redsquirrel)\n- [Vladimir Dronnikov aka `dvv`](https://github.com/dvv)\n- [Umair Siddique aka `umairsiddique`](https://github.com/umairsiddique)\n- [Louis-Philippe Perron aka `lp`](https://github.com/lp)\n- [Mark Dawson aka `markdaws`](https://github.com/markdaws)\n- [Ian Babrou aka `bobrik`](https://github.com/bobrik)\n- [Felix Geisendörfer aka `felixge`](https://github.com/felixge)\n- [Jean-Hugues Pinson aka `undefined`](https://github.com/undefined)\n- [Maksim Lin aka `maks`](https://github.com/maks)\n- [Owen Smith aka `orls`](https://github.com/orls)\n- [Zachary Scott aka `zzak`](https://github.com/zzak)\n- [TEHEK Firefox aka `TEHEK`](https://github.com/TEHEK)\n- [Isaac Z.

56626 silly resolved     readme: 'socket.io\n=========\n\n#### Sockets for the rest of us\n\nThe `socket.io` client is basically a simple HTTP Socket interface implementation.\nIt looks similar to WebSocket while providing additional features and\nleveraging other transports when WebSocket is not supported by the user\'s\nbrowser.\n\n```js\nvar socket = io.connect(\'http://domain.com\');\nsocket.on(\'connect\', function () {\n  // socket connected\n});\nsocket.on(\'custom event\', function () {\n  // server emitted a custom event\n});\nsocket.on(\'disconnect\', function () {\n  // socket disconnected\n});\nsocket.send(\'hi there\');\n```\n\n### Recipes\n\n#### Utilizing namespaces (ie: multiple sockets)\n\nIf you want to namespace all the messages and events emitted to a particular\nendpoint, simply specify it as part of the `connect` uri:\n\n```js\nvar chat = io.connect(\'http://localhost/chat\');\nchat.on(\'connect\', function () {\n  // chat socket connected\n});\n\nvar news = io.connect(\'/news\'); // io.connect auto-detects host\nnews.on(\'connect\', function () {\n  // news socket connected\n});\n```\n\n#### Emitting custom events\n\nTo ease with the creation of applications, you can emit custom events outside\nof the global `message` event.\n\n```js\nvar socket = io.connect();\nsocket.emit(\'server custom event\', { my: \'data\' });\n```\n\n#### Forcing disconnection\n\n```js\nvar socket = io.connect();\nsocket.on(\'connect\', function () {\n  socket.disconnect();\n});\n```\n\n### Documentation \n\n#### io#connect\n\n```js\nio.connect(uri, [options]);\n```\n\n##### Options:\n\n- *resource*\n\n    socket.io\n\n  The resource is what allows the `socket.io` server to identify incoming connections by `socket.io` clients. In other words, any HTTP server can implement socket.io and still serve other normal, non-realtime HTTP requests.\n\n- *transports*\n\n```js\n[\'websocket\', \'flashsocket\', \'htmlfile\', \'xhr-multipart\', \'xhr-polling\', \'jsonp-polling\']\n```\n\n  A list of the transports to attempt to utilize (in order of preference).\n\n- *\'connect timeout\'*\n\n```js\n5000\n```\n\n  The amount of milliseconds a transport has to create a connection before we consider it timed out.\n  \n- *\'try multiple transports\'*\n\n```js\ntrue\n```\n\n  A boolean indicating if we should try other transports when the  connectTimeout occurs.\n  \n- *reconnect*\n\n```js\ntrue\n```\n\n  A boolean indicating if we should automatically reconnect if a connection is disconnected. \n  \n- *\'reconnection delay\'*\n\n```js\n500\n```\n\n  The amount of milliseconds before we try to connect to the server again. We are using a exponential back off algorithm for the following reconnections, on each reconnect attempt this value will get multiplied (500 > 1000 > 2000 > 4000 > 8000).\n  \n\n- *\'max reconnection attempts\'*\n\n```js\n10\n```\n\n  The amount of attempts should we make using the current transport to connect to the server? After this we will do one final attempt, and re-try with all enabled transport methods before we give up.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- *options*\n\n  The passed in options combined with the defaults.\n\n- *connected*\n\n  Whether the socket is connected or not.\n  \n- *connecting*\n\n  Whether the socket is connecting or not.\n\n- *reconnecting*\n\n  Whether we are reconnecting or not.\n  \n- *transport*  \n\n  The transport instance.\n\n##### Methods:\n  \n- *connect(λ)*\n\n  Establishes a connection. If λ is supplied as argument, it will be called once the connection is established.\n  \n- *send(message)*\n  \n  A string of data to send.\n  \n- *disconnect*\n\n  Closes the connection.\n  \n- *on(event, λ)*\n\n  Adds a listener for the event *event*.\n\n- *once(event, λ)*\n\n  Adds a one time listener for the event *event*. The listener is removed after the first time the event is fired.\n  \n- *removeListener(event, λ)*\n\n  Removes the listener λ for the event *event*.\n  \n##### Events:\n\n- *connect*\n\n  Fired when the connection is established and the handshake successful.\n  \n- *connecting(transport_type)*\n\n    Fired when a connection is attempted, passing the transport name.\n  \n- *connect_failed*\n\n    Fired when the connection timeout occurs after the last connection attempt.\n  This only fires if the `connectTimeout` option is set.\n  If the `tryTransportsOnConnectTimeout` option is set, this only fires once all\n  possible transports have been tried.\n  \n- *message(message)*\n  \n  Fired when a message arrives from the server\n\n- *close*\n\n  Fired when the connection is closed. Be careful with using this event, as some transports will fire it even under temporary, expected disconnections (such as XHR-Polling).\n  \n- *disconnect*\n\n  Fired when the connection is considered disconnected.\n  \n- *reconnect(transport_type,reconnectionAttempts)*\n\n  Fired when the connection has been re-established. This only fires if the `reconnect` option is set.\n\n- *reconnecting(reconnectionDelay,reconnectionAttempts)*\n\n  Fired when a reconnection is attempted, passing the next delay for the next reconnection.\n\n- *reconnect_failed*\n\n  Fired when all reconnection attempts have failed and we where unsuccessful in reconnecting to the server.  \n\n### Contributors\n\nGuillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt;\n\nArnout Kazemier &lt;info@3rd-eden.com&gt;\n\n### License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n',

57446 silly resolved     readme: '[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/einaros/ws.png)](http://travis-ci.org/einaros/ws)\n\n# ws: a node.js websocket library #\n\n`ws` is a simple to use websocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455, and [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js](http://web.archive.org/web/20130314230536/http://hobbycoding.posterous.com/the-fastest-websocket-module-for-nodejs).\n\nPasses the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://einaros.github.com/ws for the full reports.\n\nComes with a command line utility, `wscat`, which can either act as a server (--listen), or client (--connect); Use it to debug simple websocket services.\n\n## Protocol support ##\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera. Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`, or argument `-p 8` for wscat)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`, or argument `-p 13` for wscat)\n\n_See the echo.websocket.org example below for how to use the `protocolVersion` option._\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### Installing ###\n\n`npm install ws`\n\n### Sending and receiving text data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require(\'ws\');\nvar ws = new WebSocket(\'ws://www.host.com/path\');\nws.on(\'open\', function() {\n    ws.send(\'something\');\n});\nws.on(\'message\', function(data, flags) {\n    // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received\n    // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require(\'ws\');\nvar ws = new WebSocket(\'ws://www.host.com/path\');\nws.on(\'open\', function() {\n    var array = new Float32Array(5);\n    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) array[i] = i / 2;\n    ws.send(array, {binary: true, mask: true});\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be masked according to the websocket protocol. The same option applies for text data.\n\n### Server example ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require(\'ws\').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\nwss.on(\'connection\', function(ws) {\n    ws.on(\'message\', function(message) {\n        console.log(\'received: %s\', message);\n    });\n    ws.send(\'something\');\n});\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require(\'ws\').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\n  \nwss.broadcast = function(data) {\n\tfor(var i in this.clients)\n\t\tthis.clients[i].send(data);\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices ###\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send(\'something\');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional callback.\n// The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has actually been sent.\nws.send(\'something\', function(error) {\n    // if error is null, the send has been completed,\n    // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note**\n// that since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not*\n// be captured when this technique is used.\ntry {\n    ws.send(\'something\');\n}\ncatch (e) {\n    // handle error\n}\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require(\'ws\');\nvar ws = new WebSocket(\'ws://echo.websocket.org/\', {protocolVersion: 8, origin: \'http://websocket.org\'});\nws.on(\'open\', function() {\n    console.log(\'connected\');\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\nws.on(\'close\', function() {\n    console.log(\'disconnected\');\n});\nws.on(\'message\', function(data, flags) {\n    console.log(\'Roundtrip time: \' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + \'ms\', flags);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n    }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### wscat against echo.websocket.org ###\n\n    $ npm install -g ws\n    $ wscat -c ws://echo.websocket.org -p 8\n    connected (press CTRL+C to quit)\n    > hi there\n    < hi there\n    > are you a happy parrot?\n    < are you a happy parrot?\n\n### Other examples ###\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the examples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express 2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests ###\n\n`make test`\n\n## API Docs ##\n\nSee the doc/ directory for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## License ##\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n',

57446 silly resolved     readme: '# node-XMLHttpRequest #\n\nnode-XMLHttpRequest is a wrapper for the built-in http client to emulate the\nbrowser XMLHttpRequest object.\n\nThis can be used with JS designed for browsers to improve reuse of code and\nallow the use of existing libraries.\n\nNote: This library currently conforms to [XMLHttpRequest 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/). Version 2.0 will target [XMLHttpRequest Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/).\n\n## Usage ##\n\nHere\'s how to include the module in your project and use as the browser-based\nXHR object.\n\n\tvar XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;\n\tvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nNote: use the lowercase string "xmlhttprequest" in your require().

It is developed on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>, but it\nshould work on any JavaScript platform supporting the CommonJS module system\n(and if your platform of choice doesn\'t support CommonJS, you can easily\nimplement it, or discard the <code>exports.*</code> lines from UglifyJS sources).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe tokenizer/parser generates an abstract syntax tree from JS code.  You\ncan then traverse the AST to learn more about the code, or do various\nmanipulations on it.  This part is implemented in <a href="../lib/parse-js.js">parse-js.js</a> and it\'s a\nport to JavaScript of the excellent <a href="http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/parse-js/">parse-js</a> Common Lisp library from <a href="http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/">Marijn Haverbeke</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n( See <a href="http://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js">cl-uglify-js</a> if you\'re looking for the Common Lisp version of\nUglifyJS. )\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second part of this package, implemented in <a href="../lib/process.js">process.js</a>, inspects and\nmanipulates the AST generated by the parser to provide the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ability to re-generate JavaScript code from the AST.  Optionally\n  indented&mdash;you can use this if you want to “beautify” a program that has\n  been compressed, so that you can inspect the source.  But you can also run\n  our code generator to print out an AST without any whitespace, so you\n  achieve compression as well.\n\n</li>\n<li>shorten variable names (usually to single characters).  Our mangler will\n  analyze the code and generate proper variable names, depending on scope\n  and usage, and is smart enough to deal with globals defined elsewhere, or\n  with <code>eval()</code> calls or <code>with{}</code> statements.  In short, if <code>eval()</code> or\n  <code>with{}</code> are used in some scope, then all variables in that scope and any\n  variables in the parent scopes will remain unmangled, and any references\n  to such variables remain unmangled as well.\n\n</li>\n<li>various small optimizations that may lead to faster code but certainly\n  lead to smaller code.  Where possible, we do the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>foo["bar"]  ==&gt;  foo.bar\n\n</li>\n<li>remove block brackets <code>{}</code>\n\n</li>\n<li>join consecutive var declarations:\n    var a = 10; var b = 20; ==&gt; var a=10,b=20;\n\n</li>\n<li>resolve simple constant expressions: 1 +2 * 3 ==&gt; 7.  We only do the\n    replacement if the result occupies less bytes; for example 1/3 would\n    translate to 0.333333333333, so in this case we don\'t replace it.\n\n</li>\n<li>consecutive statements in blocks are merged into a sequence; in many\n    cases, this leaves blocks with a single statement, so then we can remove\n    the block brackets.\n\n</li>\n<li>various optimizations for IF statements:\n\n<ul>\n<li>if (foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?bar():baz();\n</li>\n<li>if (!foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?baz():bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo&amp;&amp;bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (!foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo||bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) return bar(); else return baz(); ==&gt; return foo?bar():baz();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) return bar(); else something(); ==&gt; {if(foo)return bar();something()}\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li>remove some unreachable code and warn about it (code that follows a\n    <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statement, except\n    function/variable declarations).\n\n</li>\n<li>act a limited version of a pre-processor (c.f. the pre-processor of\n    C/C++) to allow you to safely replace selected global symbols with\n    specified values.  When combined with the optimisations above this can\n    make UglifyJS operate slightly more like a compilation process, in\n    that when certain symbols are replaced by constant values, entire code\n    blocks may be optimised away as unreachable.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">\n<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> <span class="target">Unsafe transformations</span>  </h3>\n<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">\n\n\n<p>\nThe following transformations can in theory break code, although they\'re\nprobably safe in most practical cases.

This is ON\n  by default because it seems safe and saves a few hundred bytes on some\n  libs that I tested it on, but pass <code>--no-seqs</code> to disable it.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--no-dead-code</code> &mdash; by default, UglifyJS will remove code that is\n  obviously unreachable (code that follows a <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or\n  <code>continue</code> statement and is not a function/variable declaration).  Pass\n  this option to disable this optimization.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nc</code> or <code>--no-copyright</code> &mdash; by default, <code>uglifyjs</code> will keep the initial\n  comment tokens in the generated code (assumed to be copyright information\n  etc.).  If you pass this it will discard it.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-o filename</code> or <code>--output filename</code> &mdash; put the result in <code>filename</code>.  If\n  this isn\'t given, the result goes to standard output (or see next one).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--overwrite</code> &mdash; if the code is read from a file (not from STDIN) and you\n  pass <code>--overwrite</code> then the output will be written in the same file.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--ast</code> &mdash; pass this if you want to get the Abstract Syntax Tree instead\n  of JavaScript as output.  Useful for debugging or learning more about the\n  internals.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code> &mdash; output some notes on STDERR (for now just how long\n  each operation takes).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-d SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> or <code>--define SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> &mdash; will replace\n  all instances of the specified symbol where used as an identifier\n  (except where symbol has properly declared by a var declaration or\n  use as function parameter or similar) with the specified value. This\n  argument may be specified multiple times to define multiple\n  symbols - if no value is specified the symbol will be replaced with\n  the value <code>true</code>, or you can specify a numeric value (such as\n  <code>1024</code>), a quoted string value (such as ="object"= or\n  =\'https://github.com\'<code>), or the name of another symbol or keyword   (such as =null</code> or <code>document</code>).\n  This allows you, for example, to assign meaningful names to key\n  constant values but discard the symbolic names in the uglified\n  version for brevity/efficiency, or when used wth care, allows\n  UglifyJS to operate as a form of <b>conditional compilation</b>\n  whereby defining appropriate values may, by dint of the constant\n  folding and dead code removal features above, remove entire\n  superfluous code blocks (e.g. completely remove instrumentation or\n  trace code for production use).\n  Where string values are being defined, the handling of quotes are\n  likely to be subject to the specifics of your command shell\n  environment, so you may need to experiment with quoting styles\n  depending on your platform, or you may find the option\n  <code>--define-from-module</code> more suitable for use.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-define-from-module SOMEMODULE</code> &mdash; will load the named module (as\n  per the NodeJS <code>require()</code> function) and iterate all the exported\n  properties of the module defining them as symbol names to be defined\n  (as if by the <code>--define</code> option) per the name of each property\n  (i.e. without the module name prefix) and given the value of the\n  property. This is a much easier way to handle and document groups of\n  symbols to be defined rather than a large number of <code>--define</code>\n  options.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--unsafe</code> &mdash; enable other additional optimizations that are known to be\n  unsafe in some contrived situations, but could still be generally useful.\n  For now only these:\n\n<ul>\n<li>foo.toString()  ==&gt;  foo+""\n</li>\n<li>new Array(x,&hellip;)  ==&gt; [x,&hellip;]\n</li>\n<li>new Array(x) ==&gt; Array(x)\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--max-line-len</code> (default 32K characters) &mdash; add a newline after around\n  32K characters.  I\'ve seen both FF and Chrome croak when all the code was\n  on a single line of around 670K.  Pass &ndash;max-line-len 0 to disable this\n  safety feature.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--reserved-names</code> &mdash; some libraries rely on certain names to be used, as\n  pointed out in issue #92 and #81, so this option allow you to exclude such\n  names from the mangler.  For example, to keep names <code>require</code> and <code>$super</code>\n  intact you\'d specify &ndash;reserved-names "require,$super".\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--inline-script</code> &ndash; when you want to include the output literally in an\n  HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag you can use this option to prevent <code>&lt;/script</code> from\n  showing up in the output.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--lift-vars</code> &ndash; when you pass this, UglifyJS will apply the following\n  transformations (see the notes in API, <code>ast_lift_variables</code>):\n\n<ul>\n<li>put all <code>var</code> declarations at the start of the scope\n</li>\n<li>make sure a variable is declared only once\n</li>\n<li>discard unused function arguments\n</li>\n<li>discard unused inner (named) functions\n</li>\n<li>finally, try to merge assignments into that one <code>var</code> declaration, if\n    possible.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="outline-container-1-4-1" class="outline-4">\n<h4 id="sec-1-4-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.1</span> API </h4>\n<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">\n\n\n<p>\nTo use the library from JavaScript, you\'d do the following (example for\nNodeJS):\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class="src src-js"><span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">jsp</span> = require(<span class="org-string">"uglify-js"</span>).parser;\n<span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">pro</span> = require(<span class="org-string">"uglify-js"</span>).uglify;\n\n<span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">orig_code</span> = <span class="org-string">"...

As you\ncan see, there are a sequence of steps which you can apply.  For example if\nyou want compressed output but for some reason you don\'t want to mangle\nvariable names, you would simply skip the line that calls\n<code>pro.ast_mangle(ast)</code>.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome of these functions take optional arguments.  Here\'s a description:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jsp.parse(code, strict_semicolons)</code> &ndash; parses JS code and returns an AST.\n  <code>strict_semicolons</code> is optional and defaults to <code>false</code>.  If you pass\n  <code>true</code> then the parser will throw an error when it expects a semicolon and\n  it doesn\'t find it.  For most JS code you don\'t want that, but it\'s useful\n  if you want to strictly sanitize your code.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>pro.ast_lift_variables(ast)</code> &ndash; merge and move <code>var</code> declarations to the\n  scop of the scope; discard unused function arguments or variables; discard\n  unused (named) inner functions.  It also tries to merge assignments\n  following the <code>var</code> declaration into it.\n\n<p>\n  If your code is very hand-optimized concerning <code>var</code> declarations, this\n  lifting variable declarations might actually increase size.  For me it\n  helps out.  On jQuery it adds 865 bytes (243 after gzip).  YMMV.  Also\n  note that (since it\'s not enabled by default) this operation isn\'t yet\n  heavily tested (please report if you find issues!).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Note that although it might increase the image size (on jQuery it gains\n  865 bytes, 243 after gzip) it\'s technically more correct: in certain\n  situations, dead code removal might drop variable declarations, which\n  would not happen if the variables are lifted in advance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Here\'s an example of what it does:\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<pre class="src src-js"><span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">f</span>(<span class="org-variable-name">a</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">b</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">c</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">d</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">e</span>) {\n    <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">q</span>;\n    <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">w</span>;\n    w = 10;\n    q = 20;\n    <span class="org-keyword">for</span> (<span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n        <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">boo</span> = foo(a);\n    }\n    <span class="org-keyword">for</span> (<span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {\n        <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">boo</span> = bar(c);\n    }\n    <span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span>(){ ... }\n    <span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">bar</span>(){ ... }\n    <span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span>(){ ... }\n}\n\n<span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">transforms into ==&gt;</span>\n\n<span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">f</span>(<span class="org-variable-name">a</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">b</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">c</span>) {\n    <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">boo</span>, <span class="org-variable-name">w</span> = 10, <span class="org-variable-name">q</span> = 20;\n    <span class="org-keyword">for</span> (i = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n        boo = foo(a);\n    }\n    <span class="org-keyword">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {\n        boo = bar(c);\n    }\n    <span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span>() { ... }\n    <span class="org-keyword">function</span> <span class="org-function-name">bar</span>() { ... }\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pro.ast_mangle(ast, options)</code> &ndash; generates a new AST containing mangled\n  (compressed) variable and function names.

Returns a new AST.  <code>options</code> can be a hash; the supported options\n  are:\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>make_seqs</code> (default true) which will cause consecutive statements in a\n    block to be merged using the "sequence" (comma) operator\n\n</li>\n<li><code>dead_code</code> (default true) which will remove unreachable code.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li><code>pro.gen_code(ast, options)</code> &ndash; generates JS code from the AST.  By\n  default it\'s minified, but using the <code>options</code> argument you can get nicely\n  formatted output.  <code>options</code> is, well, optional :-) and if you pass it it\n  must be an object and supports the following properties (below you can see\n  the default values):\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>beautify: false</code> &ndash; pass <code>true</code> if you want indented output\n</li>\n<li><code>indent_start: 0</code> (only applies when <code>beautify</code> is <code>true</code>) &ndash; initial\n    indentation in spaces\n</li>\n<li><code>indent_level: 4</code> (only applies when <code>beautify</code> is <code>true</code>) --\n    indentation level, in spaces (pass an even number)\n</li>\n<li><code>quote_keys: false</code> &ndash; if you pass <code>true</code> it will quote all keys in\n    literal objects\n</li>\n<li><code>space_colon: false</code> (only applies when <code>beautify</code> is <code>true</code>) &ndash; wether\n    to put a space before the colon in object literals\n</li>\n<li><code>ascii_only: false</code> &ndash; pass <code>true</code> if you want to encode non-ASCII\n    characters as <code>\\uXXXX</code>.\n</li>\n<li><code>inline_script: false</code> &ndash; pass <code>true</code> to escape occurrences of\n    <code>&lt;/script</code> in strings\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="outline-container-1-4-2" class="outline-4">\n<h4 id="sec-1-4-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.2</span> Beautifier shortcoming &ndash; no more comments </h4>\n<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-2">\n\n\n<p>\nThe beautifier can be used as a general purpose indentation tool.

58027 silly resolved     readme: 'This is a JavaScript parser.\nhttp://github.com/qfox/ZeParser\n(c) Peter van der Zee\nhttp://qfox.nl\n\n\nBenchmark\nhttp://qfox.github.com/ZeParser/benchmark.html\n\nThe Tokenizer is used by the parser. The parser tells the tokenizer whether the next token may be a regular expression or not. Without the parser, the tokenizer will fail if regular expression literals are used in the input.\n\nUsage:\nZeParser.parse(input);\n\nReturns a "parse tree" which is a tree of an array of arrays with tokens (regular objects) as leafs. Meta information embedded as properties (of the arrays and the tokens).\n\nZeParser.createParser(input);\n\nReturns a new ZeParser instance which has already parsed the input. Amongst others, the ZeParser instance will have the properties .tree, .wtree and .btree.\n\n.tree is the parse tree mentioned above.\n.wtree ("white" tree) is a regular array with all the tokens encountered (including whitespace, line terminators and comments)\n.btree ("black" tree) is just like .wtree but without the whitespace, line terminators and comments. This is what the specification would call the "token stream".\n\nI\'m aware that the naming convention is a bit awkward. It\'s a tradeoff between short and descriptive. The streams are used quite often in the analysis.\n\nTokens are regular objects with several properties. Amongst them are .tokposw and .tokposw, they correspond with their own position in the .wtree and .btree.\n\nThe parser has two modes for parsing: simple and extended. Simple mode is mainly for just parsing and returning the streams and a simple parse tree. There\'s not so much meta information here and this mode is mainly built for speed. The other mode has everything required for Zeon to do its job. This mode is toggled by the instance property .ast, which is true by default :)\n\nNon-factory example:\n\nvar input = "foo";\nvar tree = []; // this should probably be refactored away some day\nvar tokenizer = new Tokenizer(input); // dito\nvar parser = new ZeParser(input, tokenizer, tree);\nparser.parse(); // returns tree..., should never throw errors\n',

58079 silly resolved     readme: '# Commander.js\n\n  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby\'s [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).\n\n [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install commander\n\n## Option parsing\n\n Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require(\'commander\');\n\nprogram\n  .version(\'0.0.1\')\n  .option(\'-p, --peppers\', \'Add peppers\')\n  .option(\'-P, --pineapple\', \'Add pineapple\')\n  .option(\'-b, --bbq\', \'Add bbq sauce\')\n  .option(\'-c, --cheese [type]\', \'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\', \'marble\')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(\'you ordered a pizza with:\');\nif (program.peppers) console.log(\'  - peppers\');\nif (program.pineapple) console.log(\'  - pineappe\');\nif (program.bbq) console.log(\'  - bbq\');\nconsole.log(\'  - %s cheese\', program.cheese);\n```\n\n Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.\n\n## Automated --help\n\n The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:\n\n```  \n $ ./examples/pizza --help\n\n   Usage: pizza [options]\n\n   Options:\n\n     -V, --version        output the version number\n     -p, --peppers        Add peppers\n     -P, --pineapple      Add pineappe\n     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce\n     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\n     -h, --help           output usage information\n\n```\n\n## Coercion\n\n```js\nfunction range(val) {\n  return val.split(\'..\').map(Number);\n}\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(\',\');\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version(\'0.0.1\')\n  .usage(\'[options] <file ...>\')\n  .option(\'-i, --integer <n>\', \'An integer argument\', parseInt)\n  .option(\'-f, --float <n>\', \'A float argument\', parseFloat)\n  .option(\'-r, --range <a>..<b>\', \'A range\', range)\n  .option(\'-l, --list <items>\', \'A list\', list)\n  .option(\'-o, --optional [value]\', \'An optional value\')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(\' int: %j\', program.integer);\nconsole.log(\' float: %j\', program.float);\nconsole.log(\' optional: %j\', program.optional);\nprogram.range = program.range || [];\nconsole.log(\' range: %j..%j\', program.range[0], program.range[1]);\nconsole.log(\' list: %j\', program.list);\nconsole.log(\' args: %j\', program.args);\n```\n\n## Custom help\n\n You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information\n by listening for "--help". Commander will automatically\n exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program\n does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example\n in the following executable "stuff" will not output when\n `--help` is used.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require(\'../\');\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(\',\').map(Number);\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version(\'0.0.1\')\n  .option(\'-f, --foo\', \'enable some foo\')\n  .option(\'-b, --bar\', \'enable some bar\')\n  .option(\'-B, --baz\', \'enable some baz\');\n\n// must be before .parse() since\n// node\'s emit() is immediate\n\nprogram.on(\'--help\', function(){\n  console.log(\'  Examples:\');\n  console.log(\'\');\n  console.log(\'    $ custom-help --help\');\n  console.log(\'    $ custom-help -h\');\n  console.log(\'\');\n});\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(\'stuff\');\n```\n\nyielding the following help output:\n\n```\n\nUsage: custom-help [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -V, --version  output the version number\n  -f, --foo      enable some foo\n  -b, --bar      enable some bar\n  -B, --baz      enable some baz\n\nExamples:\n\n  $ custom-help --help\n  $ custom-help -h\n\n```\n\n## .prompt(msg, fn)\n\n Single-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt(\'name: \', function(name){\n  console.log(\'hi %s\', name);\n});\n```\n\n Multi-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt(\'description:\', function(name){\n  console.log(\'hi %s\', name);\n});\n```\n\n Coercion:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt(\'Age: \', Number, function(age){\n  console.log(\'age: %j\', age);\n});\n```\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt(\'Birthdate: \', Date, function(date){\n  console.log(\'date: %s\', date);\n});\n```\n\n## .password(msg[, mask], fn)\n\nPrompt for password without echoing:\n\n```js\nprogram.password(\'Password: \', function(pass){\n  console.log(\'got "%s"\', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nPrompt for password with mask char "*":\n\n```js\nprogram.password(\'Password: \', \'*\', function(pass){\n  console.log(\'got "%s"\', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\n## .confirm(msg, fn)\n\n Confirm with the given `msg`:\n\n```js\nprogram.confirm(\'continue? \', function(ok){\n  console.log(\' got %j\', ok);\n});\n```\n\n## .choose(list, fn)\n\n Let the user choose from a `list`:\n\n```js\nvar list = [\'tobi\', \'loki\', \'jane\', \'manny\', \'luna\'];\n\nconsole.log(\'Choose the coolest pet:\');\nprogram.choose(list, function(i){\n  console.log(\'you chose %d "%s"\', i, list[i]);\n});\n```\n\n## Links\n\n - [API documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js/)\n - [ascii tables](https://github.com/LearnBoost/cli-table)\n - [progress bars](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-progress)\n - [more progress bars](https://github.com/substack/node-multimeter)\n - [examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/tree/master/examples)\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.',

58079 silly resolved     readme: 'Native Abstractions for Node.js\n===============================\n\n**A header file filled with macro and utility goodness for making addon development for Node.js easier across versions 0.8, 0.10 and 0.11, and eventually 0.12.**\n\n***Current version: 0.3.2*** *(See [nan.h](https://github.com/rvagg/nan/blob/master/nan.h) for changelog)*\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/nan.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/nan/) [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/nan.png?months=6)](https://nodei.co/npm/nan/)\n\nThanks to the crazy changes in V8 (and some in Node core), keeping native addons compiling happily across versions, particularly 0.10 to 0.11/0.12, is a minor nightmare. The goal of this project is to store all logic necessary to develop native Node.js addons without having to inspect `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` and get yourself into a macro-tangle.\n\nThis project also contains some helper utilities that make addon development a bit more pleasant.\n\n * **[Usage](#usage)**\n * **[Example](#example)**\n * **[API](#api)**\n\n<a name="usage"></a>\n## Usage\n\nSimply add **NAN** as a dependency in the *package.json* of your Node addon:\n\n```js\n"dependencies": {\n    ...\n    "nan" : "~0.3.1"\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nPull in the path to **NAN** in your *binding.gyp* so that you can use `#include "nan.h"` in your *.cpp*:\n\n```js\n"include_dirs" : [\n    ...\n    "<!(node -p -e \\"require(\'path\').dirname(require.resolve(\'nan\'))\\")"\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nThis works like a `-I<path-to-NAN>` when compiling your addon.\n\n<a name="example"></a>\n## Example\n\nSee **[LevelDOWN](https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown/pull/48)** for a full example of **NAN** in use.\n\nFor a simpler example, see the **[async pi estimation example](https://github.com/rvagg/nan/tree/master/examples/async_pi_estimate)** in the examples directory for full code and an explanation of what this Monte Carlo Pi estimation example does. Below are just some parts of the full example that illustrate the use of **NAN**.\n\nCompare to the current 0.10 version of this example, found in the [node-addon-examples](https://github.com/rvagg/node-addon-examples/tree/master/9_async_work) repository and also a 0.11 version of the same found [here](https://github.com/kkoopa/node-addon-examples/tree/5c01f58fc993377a567812597e54a83af69686d7/9_async_work).\n\nNote that there is no embedded version sniffing going on here and also the async work is made much simpler, see below for details on the `NanAsyncWorker` class.\n\n```c++\n// addon.cc\n#include <node.h>\n#include "nan.h"\n// ...\n\nusing namespace v8;\n\nvoid InitAll(Handle<Object> exports) {\n  exports->Set(NanSymbol("calculateSync"),\n    FunctionTemplate::New(CalculateSync)->GetFunction());\n\n  exports->Set(NanSymbol("calculateAsync"),\n    FunctionTemplate::New(CalculateAsync)->GetFunction());\n}\n\nNODE_MODULE(addon, InitAll)\n```\n\n```c++\n// sync.h\n#include <node.h>\n#include "nan.h"\n\nNAN_METHOD(CalculateSync);\n```\n\n```c++\n//

methods:\n\n```c++\n// .h:\nclass Foo : public node::ObjectWrap {\n  ...\n\n  static NAN_METHOD(Bar);\n  static NAN_METHOD(Baz);\n}\n\n\n// .cc:\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Bar) {\n  ...\n}\n\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Baz) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe reason for this macro is because of the method signature change in 0.11:\n\n```c++\n// 0.10 and below:\nHandle<Value> name(const Arguments& args)\n\n// 0.11 and above\nvoid name(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args)\n```\n\nThe introduction of `FunctionCallbackInfo` brings additional complications:\n\n<a name="api_nan_getter"></a>\n### NAN_GETTER(methodname)\n\nUse `NAN_GETTER` to declare your V8 accessible getters. You get a `Local<String>` `property` and an appropriately typed `args` object that can act like the `args` argument to a `NAN_METHOD` call.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_GETTER`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_setter"></a>\n### NAN_SETTER(methodname)\n\nUse `NAN_SETTER` to declare your V8 accessible setters. Same as `NAN_GETTER` but you also get a `Local<Value>` `value` object to work with.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_SETTER`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_property_getter"></a>\n### NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER(cbname)\nUse `NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER` to declare your V8 accessible property getters. You get a `Local<String>` `property` and an appropriately typed `args` object that can act similar to the `args` argument to a `NAN_METHOD` call.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_property_setter"></a>\n### NAN_PROPERTY_SETTER(cbname)\nUse `NAN_PROPERTY_SETTER` to declare your V8 accessible property setters. Same as `NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER` but you also get a `Local<Value>` `value` object to work with.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_PROPERTY_SETTER`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_property_enumerator"></a>\n### NAN_PROPERTY_ENUMERATOR(cbname)\nUse `NAN_PROPERTY_ENUMERATOR` to declare your V8 accessible property enumerators. You get an appropriately typed `args` object like the `args` argument to a `NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER` call.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_PROPERTY_ENUMERATOR`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_property_deleter"></a>\n### NAN_PROPERTY_DELETER(cbname)\nUse `NAN_PROPERTY_DELETER` to declare your V8 accessible property deleters. Same as `NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER`.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_PROPERTY_DELETER`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_property_query"></a>\n### NAN_PROPERTY_QUERY(cbname)\nUse `NAN_PROPERTY_QUERY` to declare your V8 accessible property queries. Same as `NAN_PROPERTY_GETTER`.\n\nYou can use `NanReturnNull()`, `NanReturnEmptyString()`, `NanReturnUndefined()` and `NanReturnValue()` in a `NAN_PROPERTY_QUERY`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_weak_callback"></a>\n### NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK(type, cbname)\n\nUse `NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK` to declare your V8 WeakReference callbacks. There is an object argument accessible through `NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK_OBJECT`. The `type` argument gives the type of the `data` argument, accessible through `NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK_DATA(type)`.\n\n```c++\nstatic NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK(BufferReference*, WeakCheck) {\n  if (NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK_DATA(BufferReference*)->noLongerNeeded_) {\n    delete NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK_DATA(BufferReference*);\n  } else {\n    // Still in use, revive, prevent GC\n    NanMakeWeak(NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK_OBJECT, NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK_DATA(BufferReference*), &WeakCheck);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n<a name="api_nan_return_value"></a>\n### NanReturnValue(Handle&lt;Value&gt;)\n\nUse `NanReturnValue` when you want to return a value from your V8 accessible method:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Bar) {\n  ...\n\n  NanReturnValue(String::New("FooBar!"));\n}\n```\n\nNo `return` statement required.\n\n<a name="api_nan_return_undefined"></a>\n### NanReturnUndefined()\n\nUse `NanReturnUndefined` when you don\'t want to return anything from your V8 accessible method:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Baz) {\n  ...\n\n  NanReturnUndefined();\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_return_null"></a>\n### NanReturnNull()\n\nUse `NanReturnNull` when you want to return `Null` from your V8 accessible method:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Baz) {\n  ...\n\n  NanReturnNull();\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_return_empty_string"></a>\n### NanReturnEmptyString()\n\nUse `NanReturnEmptyString` when you want to return an empty `String` from your V8 accessible method:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Baz) {\n  ...\n\n  NanReturnEmptyString();\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_scope"></a>\n### NanScope()\n\nThe introduction of `isolate` references for many V8 calls in Node 0.11 makes `NanScope()` necessary, use it in place of `HandleScope scope`:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Bar) {\n  NanScope();\n\n  NanReturnValue(String::New("FooBar!"));\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_locker"></a>\n### NanLocker()\n\nThe introduction of `isolate` references for many V8 calls in Node 0.11 makes `NanLocker()` necessary, use it in place of `Locker locker`:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Bar) {\n  NanLocker();\n  ...\n  NanUnlocker();\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_unlocker"></a>\n### NanUnlocker()\n\nThe introduction of `isolate` references for many V8 calls in Node 0.11 makes `NanUnlocker()` necessary, use it in place of `Unlocker unlocker`:\n\n```c++\nNAN_METHOD(Foo::Bar) {\n  NanLocker();\n  ...\n  NanUnlocker();\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_get_internal_field_pointer"></a>\n### void * NanGetInternalFieldPointer(Handle&lt;Object&gt;, int)\n\nGets a pointer to the internal field with at `index` from a V8 `Object` handle.\n\n```c++\nLocal<Object> obj;\n...\nNanGetInternalFieldPointer(obj, 0);\n```\n<a name="api_nan_set_internal_field_pointer"></a>\n### void NanSetInternalFieldPointer(Handle&lt;Object&gt;, int, void *)\n\nSets the value of the internal field at `index` on a V8 `Object` handle.\n\n```c++\nstatic Persistent<Function> dataWrapperCtor;\n...\nLocal<Object> wrapper = NanPersistentToLocal(dataWrapperCtor)->NewInstance();\nNanSetInternalFieldPointer(wrapper, 0, this);\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_object_wrap_handle"></a>\n### Local&lt;Object&gt; NanObjectWrapHandle(Object)\n\nWhen you want to fetch the V8 object handle from a native object you\'ve wrapped with Node\'s `ObjectWrap`, you should use `NanObjectWrapHandle`:\n\n```c++\nNanObjectWrapHandle(iterator)->Get(String::NewSymbol("end"))\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_make_weak"></a>\n### NanMakeWeak(Persistent&lt;T&gt;, parameter, callback)\n\nMake a persistent reference weak.\n\n<a name="api_nan_symbol"></a>\n### String NanSymbol(char *)\n\nThis isn\'t strictly about compatibility, it\'s just an easier way to create string symbol objects (i.e. `String::NewSymbol(x)`), for getting and setting object properties, or names of objects.\n\n```c++\nbool foo = false;\nif (obj->Has(NanSymbol("foo")))\n  foo = optionsObj->Get(NanSymbol("foo"))->BooleanValue()\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_get_pointer_safe"></a>\n### Type NanGetPointerSafe(Type *[, Type])\n\nA helper for getting values from optional pointers. If the pointer is `NULL`, the function returns the optional default value, which defaults to `0`.  Otherwise, the function returns the value the pointer points to.\n\n```c++\nchar *plugh(uint32_t *optional) {\n  char res[] = "xyzzy";\n  uint32_t param = NanGetPointerSafe<uint32_t>(optional, 0x1337);\n  switch (param) {\n    ...\n  }\n  NanSetPointerSafe<uint32_t>(optional, 0xDEADBEEF);\n}  \n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_set_pointer_safe"></a>\n### bool NanSetPointerSafe(Type *, Type)\n\nA helper for setting optional argument pointers. If the pointer is `NULL`, the function simply return `false`.  Otherwise, the value is assigned to the variable the pointer points to.\n\n```c++\nconst char *plugh(size_t *outputsize) {\n  char res[] = "xyzzy";\n  if !(NanSetPointerSafe<size_t>(outputsize, strlen(res) + 1)) {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_from_v8_string"></a>\n### char* NanFromV8String(Handle&lt;Value&gt;[, enum Nan::Encoding, size_t *, char *, size_t, int])\n\nWhen you want to convert a V8 `String` to a `char*` use `NanFromV8String`. It is possible to define an encoding that defaults to `Nan::UTF8` as well as a pointer to a variable that will be assigned the number of bytes in the returned string. It is also possible to supply a buffer and its length to the function in order not to have a new buffer allocated. The final argument allows optionally setting `String::WriteOptions`, which default to `String::HINT_MANY_WRITES_EXPECTED | String::NO_NULL_TERMINATION`.\nJust remember that you\'ll end up with an object that you\'ll need to `delete[]` at some point unless you supply your own buffer:\n\n```c++\nsize_t count;\nchar* name = NanFromV8String(args[0]);\nchar* decoded = NanFromV8String(args[1], Nan::BASE64, &count, NULL, 0, String::HINT_MANY_WRITES_EXPECTED);\nchar param_copy[count];\nmemcpy(param_copy, decoded, count);\ndelete[] decoded;\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_boolean_option_value"></a>\n### bool NanBooleanOptionValue(Handle&lt;Value&gt;, Handle&lt;String&gt;[, bool])\n\nWhen you have an "options" object that you need to fetch properties from, boolean options can be fetched with this pair. They check first if the object exists (`IsEmpty`), then if the object has the given property (`Has`) then they get and convert/coerce the property to a `bool`.\n\nThe optional last parameter is the *default* value, which is `false` if left off:\n\n```c++\n// `foo` is false unless the user supplies a truthy value for it\nbool foo = NanBooleanOptionValue(optionsObj, NanSymbol("foo"));\n// `bar` is true unless the user supplies a falsy value for it\nbool bar = NanBooleanOptionValueDefTrue(optionsObj, NanSymbol("bar"), true);\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_uint32_option_value"></a>\n### uint32_t NanUInt32OptionValue(Handle&lt;Value&gt;, Handle&lt;String&gt;, uint32_t)\n\nSimilar to `NanBooleanOptionValue`, use `NanUInt32OptionValue` to fetch an integer option from your options object. Can be any kind of JavaScript `Number` and it will be coerced to an unsigned 32-bit integer.\n\nRequires all 3 arguments as a default is not optional:\n\n```c++\nuint32_t count = NanUInt32OptionValue(optionsObj, NanSymbol("count"), 1024);\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_throw_error"></a>\n### NanThrowError(message), NanThrowTypeError(message), NanThrowRangeError(message), NanThrowError(Local&lt;Value&gt;), NanThrowError(Local&lt;Value&gt;, int)\n\nFor throwing `Error`, `TypeError` and `RangeError` objects. You should `return` this call:\n\n```c++\nreturn NanThrowError("you must supply a callback argument");\n```\n\nCan also handle any custom object you may want to throw. If used with the error code argument, it will add the supplied error code to the error object as a property called `code`.\n\n<a name="api_nan_new_buffer_handle"></a>\n### Local&lt;Object&gt; NanNewBufferHandle(char *, uint32_t), Local&lt;Object&gt; NanNewBufferHandle(uint32_t)\n\nThe `Buffer` API has changed a little in Node 0.11, this helper provides consistent access to `Buffer` creation:\n\n```c++\nNanNewBufferHandle((char*)value.data(), value.size());\n```\n\nCan also be used to initialize a `Buffer` with just a `size` argument.\n\nCan also be supplied with a `NAN_WEAK_CALLBACK` and a hint for the garbage collector, when dealing with weak references.\n\n<a name="api_nan_buffer_use"></a>\n### Local&lt;Object&gt; NanBufferUse(char*, uint32_t)\n\n`Buffer::New(char*, uint32_t)` prior to 0.11 would make a copy of the data.\nWhile it was possible to get around this, it required a shim by passing a\ncallback. So the new API `Buffer::Use(char*, uint32_t)` was introduced to remove\nneeding to use this shim.\n\n`NanBufferUse` uses the `char*` passed as the backing data, and will free the\nmemory automatically when the weak callback is called. Keep this in mind, as\ncareless use can lead to "double free or corruption" and other cryptic failures.\n\n<a name="api_nan_has_instance"></a>\n### bool NanHasInstance(Persistent&lt;FunctionTemplate&gt;&, Handle&lt;Value&gt;)\n\nCan be used to check the type of an object to determine it is of a particular class you have already defined and have a `Persistent<FunctionTemplate>` handle for.\n\n<a name="api_nan_persistent_to_local"></a>\n### Local&lt;Type&gt; NanPersistentToLocal(Persistent&lt;Type&gt;&)\n\nAside from `FunctionCallbackInfo`, the biggest and most painful change to V8 in Node 0.11 is the many restrictions now placed on `Persistent` handles. They are difficult to assign and difficult to fetch the original value out of.\n\nUse `NanPersistentToLocal` to convert a `Persistent` handle back to a `Local` handle.\n\n```c++\nLocal<Object> handle = NanPersistentToLocal(persistentHandle);\n```\n\n<a href="#api_nan_new_context_handle">\n### Local&lt;Context&gt; NanNewContextHandle([ExtensionConfiguration*, Handle&lt;ObjectTemplate&gt;, Handle&lt;Value&gt;])\nCreates a new `Local<Context>` handle.\n\n```c++\nLocal<FunctionTemplate> ftmpl = FunctionTemplate::New();\nLocal<ObjectTemplate> otmpl = ftmpl->InstanceTemplate();\nLocal<Context> ctx =  NanNewContextHandle(NULL, otmpl);\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_dispose"></a>\n### void NanDispose(Persistent&lt;T&gt; &)\n\nUse `NanDispose` to dispose a `Persistent` handle.\n\n```c++\nNanDispose(persistentHandle);\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_assign_persistent"></a>\n### NanAssignPersistent(type, handle, object)\n\nUse `NanAssignPersistent` to assign a non-`Persistent` handle to a `Persistent` one. You can no longer just declare a `Persistent` handle and assign directly to it later, you have to `Reset` it in Node 0.11, so this makes it easier.\n\nIn general it is now better to place anything you want to protect from V8\'s garbage collector as properties of a generic `Object` and then assign that to a `Persistent`. This works in older versions of Node also if you use `NanAssignPersistent`:\n\n```c++\nPersistent<Object> persistentHandle;\n\n...\n\nLocal<Object> obj = Object::New();\nobj->Set(NanSymbol("key"), keyHandle); // where keyHandle might be a Local<String>\nNanAssignPersistent(Object, persistentHandle, obj)\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_init_persistent"></a>\n### NanInitPersistent(type, name, object)\n\nUser `NanInitPersistent` to declare and initialize a new `Persistent` with the supplied object. The assignment operator for `Persistent` is no longer public in Node 0.11, so this macro makes it easier to declare and initializing a new `Persistent`. See <a href="#api_nan_assign_persistent"><b><code>NanAssignPersistent</code></b></a> for more information.\n\n```c++\nLocal<Object> obj = Object::New();\nobj->Set(NanSymbol("key"), keyHandle); // where keyHandle might be a Local<String>\nNanInitPersistent(Object, persistentHandle, obj);\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_callback"></a>\n### NanCallback\n\nBecause of the difficulties imposed by the changes to `Persistent` handles in V8 in Node 0.11, creating `Persistent` versions of your `Local<Function>` handles is annoyingly tricky. `NanCallback` makes it easier by taking your `Local` handle, making it persistent until the `NanCallback` is deleted and even providing a handy `Call()` method to fetch and execute the callback `Function`.\n\n```c++\nLocal<Function> callbackHandle = callback = args[0].As<Function>();\nNanCallback *callback = new NanCallback(callbackHandle);\n// pass `callback` around and it\'s safe from GC until you:\ndelete callback;\n```\n\nYou can execute the callback like so:\n\n```c++\n// no arguments:\ncallback->Call(0, NULL);\n\n// an error argument:\nLocal<Value> argv[] = {\n  Exception::Error(String::New("fail!"))\n};\ncallback->Call(1, argv);\n\n// a success argument:\nLocal<Value> argv[] = {\n  Local<Value>::New(Null()),\n  String::New("w00t!")\n};\ncallback->Call(2, argv);\n```\n\n`NanCallback` also has a `Local<Function> GetCallback()` method that you can use to fetch a local handle to the underlying callback function if you need it.\n\n<a name="api_nan_async_worker"></a>\n### NanAsyncWorker\n\n`NanAsyncWorker` is an abstract class that you can subclass to have much of the annoying async queuing and handling taken care of for you. It can even store arbitrary V8 objects for you and have them persist while the async work is in progress.\n\nSee a rough outline of the implementation:\n\n```c++\nclass NanAsyncWorker {\npublic:\n  NanAsyncWorker (NanCallback *callback);\n\n  // Clean up persistent handles and delete the *callback\n  virtual ~NanAsyncWorker ();\n\n  // Check the `char *errmsg` property and call HandleOKCallback()\n  // or HandleErrorCallback depending on whether it has been set or not\n  virtual void WorkComplete ();\n\n  // You must implement this to do some async work. If there is an\n  // error then allocate `errmsg` to to a message and the callback will\n  // be passed that string in an Error object\n  virtual void Execute ();\n\nprotected:\n  // Set this if there is an error, otherwise it\'s NULL\n  const char *errmsg;\n\n  // Save a V8 object in a Persistent handle to protect it from GC\n  void SavePersistent(const char *key, Local<Object> &obj);\n\n  // Fetch a stored V8 object (don\'t call from within `Execute()`)\n  Local<Object> GetFromPersistent(const char *key);\n\n  // Default implementation calls the callback function with no arguments.\n  // Override this to return meaningful data\n  virtual void HandleOKCallback ();\n\n  // Default implementation calls the callback function with an Error object\n  // wrapping the `errmsg` string\n  virtual void HandleErrorCallback ();\n};\n```\n\n<a name="api_nan_async_queue_worker"></a>\n### NanAsyncQueueWorker(NanAsyncWorker *)\n\n`NanAsyncQueueWorker` will run a `NanAsyncWorker` asynchronously via libuv. Both the *execute* and *after_work* steps are taken care of for you&mdash;most of the logic for this is embedded in `NanAsyncWorker`.\n\n### Contributors\n\nNAN is only possible due to the excellent work of the following contributors:\n\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><th align="left">Rod Vagg</th><td><a href="https://github.com/rvagg">GitHub/rvagg</a></td><td><a href="http://twitter.com/rvagg">Twitter/@rvagg</a></td></tr>\n<tr><th align="left">Benjamin Byholm</th><td><a href="https://github.com/kkoopa/">GitHub/kkoopa</a></td></tr>\n<tr><th align="left">Trevor Norris</th><td><a href="https://github.com/trevnorris">GitHub/trevnorris</a></td><td><a href="http://twitter.com/trevnorris">Twitter/@trevnorris</a></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\nLicence &amp; copyright\n-----------------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Rod Vagg & NAN contributors (listed above).\n\nNative Abstractions for Node.js is licensed under an MIT +no-false-attribs license.

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource\'s line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source)\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file\'s line/column order or the\n  original\'s source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource\'s line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren\'t in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `\'.\'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn\'t associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn\'t associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source\'s filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source\'s line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node\'s children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with "test", for example\n\n    exports["test doing the foo bar"] = function (assert, util) {\n      ...\n    };\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node\'s assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox\'s test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice\n',

A failed match will result in a `null` value being returned.\n\n    ss.reset()         // #<StringScanner 0/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.scan(/[a-z]+/)  // "abc"\n    ss                 // #<StringScanner 3/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.scan(/[a-z]+/)  // null\n    ss                 // #<StringScanner 3/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.scan(/[0-9]+/)  // "123"\n    ss                 // #<StringScanner 6/13 @ "abc12...">\n\n### scanUntil(pattern)\n*Note: this method alters last match results*\n\nAttempts to match the pattern against the string being scanned. On a successful\nmatch, the scan pointer is advanced to the end of the matched portion of the\nstring and the portion of the string being scanned up to and including the\nmatched string is returned. On a failed match, `null` is returned.\n\n    ss.reset()         // #<StringScanner 0/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.scanUntil(/ /)  // "abc123 "\n    ss.scanUntil(/f/)  // "def"\n    ss.scanUntil(/f/)  // null\n\n### skip(pattern)\n*Note: this method alters last match results*\n\nPerforms a `scan`, returning the length of the matched string on successful\nmatch, `null` otherwise.\n\n    ss.reset()         // #<StringScanner 0/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.skip(/[a-z]+/)  // 3\n    ss.skip(/[a-z]+/)  // null\n    ss.skip(/[0-9]+/)  // 3\n\n### skipUntil(pattern)\n*Note: this method alters last match results*\n\nPerforms a `scanUntil`, returning the length of the matched string on\nsuccessful match, `null` otherwise.\n\n    ss.reset()         // #<StringScanner 0/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.skipUntil(/ /)  // 7\n    ss.skipUntil(/f/)  // 3\n    ss.skipUntil(/f/)  // null\n\n### string\nReturns the entire string being scanned.\n\n    ss.string()  // "abc123 def456"\n    ss.getch()   // "a"\n    ss.string()  // "abc123 def456"\n\n### terminate / clear\nAdvances the scan pointer to the end of the string being scanned and resets the\nlast match results.\n\n    ss.reset()      // #<StringScanner 0/13 @ "abc12...">\n    ss.getch()      // "a"\n    ss.pointer()    // 1\n    ss.terminate()  // #<StringScanner fin>\n    ss.pointer()    // 13\n    ss.eos()        // true\n    ss.match()      // null\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nNot really an issue, but `StringScanner` assumes the global flag (g) is\ndisabled on any RegExp objects passed as patterns to any of its methods. If the\nglobal flag is enabled, `StringScanner` may produce unexpected results.\n\nAdditional Info\n---------------\n\nI am always open for feature requests or any feedback.  I can be reached at\n[Github](http://github.com/michaelficarra).\n\nThanks to the Ruby community for the original idea and implementation.\n',

This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',
